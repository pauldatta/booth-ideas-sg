I have generated the Astro frontend application as requested. Here are the instructions to run it locally:

```bash
# Navigate to the AI Asia directory
cd ~/"AI Asia"

# Create a directory for the new app
mkdir tool-tracker-app

# cd into the new directory
cd tool-tracker-app

# Clone the specific branch from the repository
git clone -b home-hardware-tool-tracker https://github.com/pauldatta/booth-ideas-sg.git .

# cd into the application root folder
cd tool-tracker-app

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run the development server
npm run dev
```
