# Product Requirements Document: Simple Math Calculator App

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for developing a user-friendly mobile application designed to perform basic arithmetic operations. The "Simple Math Calculator" app aims to provide individuals with a quick, reliable, and easily accessible tool for everyday mathematical calculations, addressing the common need for an efficient mobile-based solution for fundamental math tasks. This initial version will focus on core functionalities to ensure a robust and intuitive user experience.

## 2. Problem Statement

In today's fast-paced environment, individuals frequently encounter situations requiring basic mathematical calculations—whether it's splitting a restaurant bill, calculating discounts, checking homework, or balancing a budget. While mobile devices are ubiquitous, users often find themselves without a readily available or efficient tool specifically designed for these simple tasks. Default calculator apps can sometimes be clunky, laden with advanced functions that clutter the interface, or require multiple taps for basic operations. This leads to frustration, wasted time, or reliance on less accurate mental math or pen-and-paper solutions, especially when a quick, on-the-go calculation is needed. The core pain point is the lack of a streamlined, intuitive, and highly accessible mobile application focused purely on fundamental arithmetic.

## 3. Target Audience

The primary target audience for the Simple Math Calculator app is broad and inclusive, encompassing anyone who needs to perform quick, basic mathematical calculations. This includes, but is not limited to:

## 6. User Stories

Here are a few key user stories representing the core functionalities:

*   **As a student**, I want to quickly add two numbers together so that I can check my homework answers efficiently.
*   **As a shopper**, I want to easily subtract a discount percentage from a total price so that I can calculate the final cost before buying.
*   **As a professional**, I want to multiply units by a price so that I can quickly determine a total cost for an order.
*   **As a diner splitting a bill**, I want to divide the total by the number of people so that I can see each person's share.
*   **As an everyday user**, I want to clear a mistyped number without restarting the entire calculation so that I don't lose my progress.
*   **As a user calculating a budget**, I want to easily store an intermediate sum in memory and recall it later so that I can perform multi-step calculations without writing down numbers.

## 7. Technical Considerations

The technical approach will prioritize simplicity, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness, aligning with the "Proposed Tech Stack" evaluation criteria. Given the straightforward nature of a basic calculator, a native mobile application approach is recommended for optimal performance and user experience.

*   **Frontend (Mobile Application):**
    *   **iOS:** Swift with SwiftUI (for modern declarative UI, efficiency, and future-proofing).
    *   **Android:** Kotlin with Jetpack Compose (for modern declarative UI, efficiency, and native performance).
    *   **Cross-Platform (Alternative, if budget/timeline is tighter):** React Native or Flutter could be considered, but for a truly "simple" app with no complex UI/APIs, native development often provides better performance and a smaller footprint. *Initial recommendation leans towards native for simplicity and best user experience.*
*   **Backend:** For this initial version, a backend is **not required**. All calculations will be performed client-side on the user's device. This significantly reduces complexity, development time, and operational costs.
*   **Calculations Logic:** Implement robust, tested mathematical logic directly within the app's codebase. Utilize standard library functions for arithmetic operations to ensure accuracy.
*   **Architecture:** A simple Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) or Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern can be adopted for clean separation of concerns and testability within each native platform.
*   **Testing:** Implement comprehensive unit tests for the core calculation logic to ensure 100% accuracy. UI tests will also be crucial for ensuring responsiveness and correct button functionality.
*   **AI Integration:** For this initial version, AI integration is intentionally out of scope to maintain simplicity and focus on core arithmetic functionality. Future iterations *could* explore AI for natural language input parsing ("What is 5 plus 3?"), handwriting recognition for input, or intelligent error correction, but these are not critical for a V1 MVP.

## 8. Potential Risks & Mitigations

**Risk 1: Market Saturation and Differentiation**
*   **Description:** The mobile app market is flooded with calculator apps, making it challenging for a "simple math" app to stand out and attract users, as highlighted by the "Business Value" evaluation criteria.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   **Focus on Superior UX:** Emphasize an exceptionally clean, intuitive, and fast user interface that prioritizes core functionality over unnecessary features.
    *   **Performance:** Ensure the app is incredibly responsive and bug-free, making it a reliable daily driver.
    *   **Marketing Focus:** Target specific user segments (e.g., students, quick calculation needs) with marketing that highlights the app's simplicity and efficiency.
    *   **Iterative Enhancements:** Plan for future, carefully selected enhancements (e.g., basic unit conversion, subtle UI themes) that add value without compromising simplicity, as suggested by "Suggested Product Areas."

**Risk 2: Low User Adoption/Retention**
*   **Description:** Users might try the app but not find enough unique value to continue using it regularly, especially with existing default calculators.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   **User Value Focus:** Continuously gather user feedback and iterate on the app to ensure it remains highly accurate, easy to use, and accessible, directly addressing the "User Value" criteria.
    *   **Minimalist Design:** Avoid feature bloat. Every new feature considered must pass a strict "does it enhance simple math without overcomplicating?" test.
    *   **Onboarding (Minimal):** Ensure the first-time user experience is seamless and immediately showcases the app's simplicity.
    *   **Performance:** A snappy and reliable app encourages repeat usage.

**Risk 3: Technical Debt / Over-engineering**
*   **Description:** While aiming for simplicity, there's a risk of either building a fragile system or over-engineering for future features that may never materialize, increasing costs and delays.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   **Strict Scope Management:** Adhere rigorously to the V1 features list, resisting "nice-to-have" additions during the initial development phase.
    *   **Modular Architecture:** Design the app with a modular structure that allows for easy addition of future features (like unit conversions) without refactoring the core calculator logic.
    *   **Experienced Team:** Leverage a recommended team capable of efficient development and maintenance, as per "Recommended Team" criteria, who understands the balance between simplicity and scalability.

**Risk 4: Accuracy Issues**
*   **Description:** Mathematical errors, even minor ones, can completely undermine a calculator's utility and user trust.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   **Comprehensive Testing:** Implement extensive unit tests specifically for all mathematical operations and edge cases (e.g., division by zero, large numbers, floating point precision).
    *   **Standard Library Functions:** Rely on proven mathematical functions from the chosen programming languages rather than reimplementing complex logic.
    *   **Peer Review:** Code reviews focused on calculation logic.
