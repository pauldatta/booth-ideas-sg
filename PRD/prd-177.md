# Product Requirements Document: Consecutive Rainy Days Tracker

## 1. Introduction
This document outlines the requirements for a new mobile application designed to help users easily track the number of consecutive days it has rained in a specific location. The primary goal is to provide a simple, dedicated tool that offers at-a-glance insights into local rainfall patterns, empowering users to make better-informed decisions for activities significantly impacted by continuous precipitation.

## 2. Problem Statement
Many individuals and small businesses lack a straightforward, dedicated tool to monitor localized rainfall streaks. While general weather applications provide current conditions and forecasts, they often do not offer a simple, historical counter for consecutive rainy days. This absence creates several pain points:

*   **Gardening & Agriculture**: Gardeners and small-scale farmers struggle to quickly determine watering needs, risking over- or under-watering their plants. They lack a consistent, easily accessible record of recent rainfall. 
*   **Outdoor Event Planning**: Organizers of outdoor events (weddings, festivals, sports) find it challenging to assess historical rain patterns for specific dates or locations, making long-term planning difficult and increasing weather-related risks.
*   **Property Management & Maintenance**: Homeowners and property managers might miss early indicators of prolonged dampness that could lead to issues like mold, pest infestations, or structural damage if they don't have an easy way to track continuous wet periods.
*   **Personal Curiosity & Planning**: Many people are simply curious about local weather trends or need this information for daily planning (e.g., deciding whether to hang laundry outside, planning a walk). Existing tools are often cumbersome for this specific data point.

The core problem is the absence of a focused, user-friendly solution that allows manual logging and clear visualization of consecutive rainy days, leading to inefficient planning and missed opportunities for proactive management.

## 3. Target Audience
The primary users for the Consecutive Rainy Days Tracker are individuals and small businesses who require an at-a-glance understanding of local rainfall trends. This includes, but is not limited to:

*   **Hobbyist Gardeners & Small Farmers**: Motivated by a desire to optimize plant health, conserve water, and make informed decisions about irrigation. They need quick access to local rainfall history to avoid over-watering or ensure adequate hydration.
*   **Outdoor Enthusiasts & Event Planners**: Individuals who participate in or organize outdoor activities (hikers, campers, sports coaches, event managers). Their motivation is to plan activities around weather patterns, minimize disruptions, and ensure safety and enjoyment. They seek reliable historical data for specific locations.
*   **Homeowners & Property Managers**: Concerned with property upkeep, especially related to moisture. They are motivated by preventing issues like dampness, mold, and assessing the need for drainage improvements. They need a simple record of sustained wet conditions.
*   **Curious Locals**: General users interested in local climate patterns, perhaps for personal knowledge, local community discussions, or simply to track an interesting weather phenomenon. They are motivated by ease of use and immediate access to information.

Their shared goal is to easily log and visualize current and historical rainfall data for their specific locations, enabling better planning and resource management, and satisfying a unique curiosity about localized rain streaks.
