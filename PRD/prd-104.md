# Product Requirements Document: HydroTrack

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for **HydroTrack**, a new mobile application designed to help individuals effortlessly monitor and improve their daily water intake. Many people recognize the critical importance of hydration for overall health but struggle with consistent tracking. HydroTrack aims to solve this problem by providing a user-friendly, motivating, and intelligent tool that simplifies the process of logging water consumption, setting personalized goals, and visualizing progress. Our ultimate goal is to empower users to achieve and maintain optimal hydration levels, contributing to better health and well-being.

## 2. Problem Statement

Despite widespread awareness of hydration's benefits (e.g., improved energy, skin health, cognitive function, weight management), a significant number of individuals consistently fail to drink adequate amounts of water daily. The core problem stems from a lack of an easy, consistent, and motivating system for tracking intake. Pain points include:

*   **Forgetfulness:** Users often forget how much water they've consumed throughout the day, leading to inconsistent tracking and underestimation of intake.
*   **Lack of Structure:** Without a clear daily goal or a simple method to log, hydration becomes a haphazard activity rather than a mindful habit.
*   **Inconvenience:** Existing methods (manual logging, mental math) are often cumbersome, time-consuming, and prone to error, discouraging regular use.
*   **Lack of Personalization:** Generic hydration advice doesn't account for individual needs, such as activity level, climate, body weight, or specific health conditions, making it difficult for users to determine their optimal intake.
*   **Absence of Motivation & Feedback:** Users lack real-time feedback and motivation to reach their goals, leading to a decline in sustained effort and habit formation.
*   **Difficulty in Habit Formation:** Consistently tracking and achieving hydration goals is challenging, preventing the formation of long-term healthy habits.

HydroTrack aims to alleviate these pain points by offering a streamlined, intelligent, and engaging solution that makes daily water tracking effortless and insightful.

## 3. Target Audience

Our primary target audience for HydroTrack includes:

*   **Health-Conscious Individuals (25-55 years old):** These users are generally proactive about their health, engage in regular physical activity, and understand the benefits of hydration. They are often looking for tools to optimize their well-being, improve energy levels, enhance fitness performance, or manage specific health goals (e.g., weight loss, skin clarity). They value data-driven insights and convenience.
    *   **Motivations:** To maintain a healthy lifestyle, improve physical performance, manage weight, enhance skin health, boost cognitive function, and prevent dehydration-related issues.
    *   **Goals:** To consistently meet their daily water intake goals, understand how hydration impacts their health, and integrate healthy habits into their daily routine.
*   **Individuals Aiming to Improve Hydration Habits (18-65 years old):** This broader group may not be intensely health-conscious but recognizes they don't drink enough water. They are looking for a simple, non-intimidating way to start, track, and sustain better hydration habits. They might be new to health tracking or find existing solutions too complex.
    *   **Motivations:** To feel better, increase energy, reduce headaches, follow doctor's recommendations, or simply adopt a healthier habit.
    *   **Goals:** To establish a regular water intake routine, receive gentle reminders, track progress easily, and build confidence in their ability to stay hydrated.

Both segments are likely smartphone users, comfortable with mobile applications, and open to using technology to support their health and wellness journey.
