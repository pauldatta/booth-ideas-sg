# Product Requirements Document: Ingredient-Based Recipe Suggester

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a new mobile application designed to address the common challenge of meal planning using existing ingredients. The **Ingredient-Based Recipe Suggester** aims to empower home cooks by providing personalized recipe recommendations based on the ingredients they currently have on hand. By leveraging intelligent algorithms, the application will help users discover new culinary possibilities, reduce food waste, and make the meal preparation process more efficient and enjoyable. This product seeks to transform how individuals approach home cooking, making it easier, more resourceful, and less stressful.

## 2. Problem Statement

Many individuals frequently find themselves staring into a well-stocked pantry or refrigerator, yet feeling uninspired or unsure of what to cook. This common dilemma leads to several pain points:

*   **Food Waste:** Perishable ingredients often go unused and spoil before they can be incorporated into a meal, contributing to significant household food waste and financial loss.
*   **Decision Fatigue:** The sheer volume of recipe options available online can be overwhelming, making it difficult for users to pinpoint recipes that align with their current ingredient availability.
*   **Repetitive Meals:** Users often default to cooking the same familiar dishes, even when they have ingredients for more varied meals, simply due to a lack of creativity or time to search for new recipes.
*   **Inefficient Grocery Use:** Groceries purchased with good intentions sometimes sit unused because they don't fit into a coherent meal plan, leading to sub-optimal utilization of food resources.
*   **Time Consumption:** Manually searching for recipes that match available ingredients is a time-consuming and often frustrating process.

The absence of an intuitive tool that bridges the gap between available ingredients and inspiring recipes directly contributes to these challenges, hindering efficient home cooking.
