# Product Requirements Document: Computer Asset Assignment Application

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a new application designed to streamline and automate the process of assigning computer assets to employees within an organization. Currently, many organizations face significant challenges in efficiently and accurately tracking their computer inventory and the assignments made to individual personnel. This product, tentatively named "AssetFlow," aims to provide a centralized, intelligent solution to improve asset management efficiency, reduce operational overhead, and minimize discrepancies in computer assignments, ultimately enhancing the overall employee onboarding and IT asset lifecycle management experience.

## 2. Problem Statement

Organizations frequently encounter considerable difficulties in managing their valuable computer assets. The current manual or disparate tracking methods are fraught with several pain points:

*   **Time-Consuming Processes:** Assigning, tracking, and recovering computer assets often involves manual spreadsheets, disparate systems, and time-consuming paperwork, leading to significant administrative overhead for IT administrators and asset managers.
*   **Prone to Errors:** Manual data entry and tracking are inherently susceptible to human error, resulting in inaccurate inventory counts, incorrect assignments, and difficulty in locating specific assets.
*   **Lack of Real-time Visibility:** Without a centralized system, IT teams lack real-time visibility into available assets, assigned assets, and their current status, making it challenging to make informed decisions and respond quickly to hardware requests.
*   **Inefficient Resource Utilization:** Difficulty in identifying underutilized or available assets leads to suboptimal hardware utilization and potentially unnecessary new equipment purchases.
*   **Onboarding/Offboarding Challenges:** The absence of a streamlined assignment process complicates employee onboarding (delaying equipment provision) and offboarding (difficulty in asset recovery), impacting productivity and increasing security risks.
*   **Discrepancies and Auditing Issues:** Inaccurate records lead to discrepancies during audits, potentially resulting in financial penalties or compliance issues.

These issues collectively contribute to increased operational costs, reduced efficiency, and frustration for both IT staff and employees awaiting equipment.

## 3. Target Audience

3.  **Optimize Hardware Utilization:** Provide actionable insights that lead to a 15% improvement in the utilization rate of existing computer assets within 12 months, thereby reducing unnecessary procurement.
4.  **Enhance User (IT Admin) Efficiency:** Streamline the asset assignment process, enabling IT administrators to complete a standard computer assignment in under 5 minutes on average.
5.  **Provide Real-time Visibility:** Establish a single, centralized source of truth for all computer assets and their assignments, accessible in real-time to authorized personnel.
6.  **Implement Intelligent Assignment:** Develop and integrate an AI-powered recommendation engine that suggests optimal computer assignments based on employee profiles and available resources, aiming for a 75% adoption rate of AI recommendations within 12 months.
