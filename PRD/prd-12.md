# Product Requirements Document: Ingredient-Based Recipe App

## 1. Introduction
This document outlines the requirements for a new mobile application designed to revolutionize home cooking and reduce food waste. The application, tentatively named "Chef's Companion," will leverage artificial intelligence to suggest recipes based on ingredients users currently have on hand. Its primary goal is to empower individuals to make the most of their existing groceries, simplify meal planning, and foster culinary creativity, ultimately leading to more efficient kitchens and less food waste.

## 2. Problem Statement
Many individuals face a common dilemma: a refrigerator and pantry full of various ingredients, yet a blank mind when it comes to deciding what to cook. This often leads to several pain points:

*   **Food Waste:** Perishable ingredients expire or go unused because users lack inspiration or knowledge of how to combine them into a meal.
*   **Meal Prep Fatigue:** The daily or weekly struggle of planning meals can be time-consuming and stressful, leading to repetitive dishes or resorting to takeout.
*   **Financial Drain:** Unused groceries represent wasted money, and frequent takeout meals can be costly.
*   **Lack of Creativity:** Users may stick to a limited repertoire of recipes, missing out on the diverse culinary possibilities their existing ingredients offer.
*   **Ingredient Overwhelm:** Having too many options without a clear direction can be paralyzing, leading to inaction.

Our product aims to directly address these pain points by transforming a collection of disparate ingredients into a source of immediate culinary inspiration.

## 3. Target Audience
