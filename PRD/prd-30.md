# Product Requirements Document: HarmonyFlow - AI-Powered Music Sorting Application

## 1. Introduction

HarmonyFlow is an innovative music application designed to revolutionize how users manage and experience their digital music collections. This document outlines the requirements for developing an AI-powered platform that automatically sorts and categorizes music titles based on sophisticated algorithms, user-configurable preferences, and rich metadata. The primary goal is to provide a seamless, intuitive, and highly efficient way for users to organize, discover, and enjoy their extensive music libraries, transforming a previously cumbersome task into a streamlined and satisfying experience.

## 2. Problem Statement

In the digital age, many music enthusiasts have accumulated vast personal music libraries, often spanning thousands of tracks from various sources. This abundance, while rich, presents significant organizational challenges. Listeners frequently encounter difficulties in:

*   **Finding Specific Tracks:** Manually sifting through large, unsorted lists to locate a particular song, artist, or album is time-consuming and frustrating.
*   **Lack of Granular Organization:** Existing music players often offer basic sorting by artist, album, or genre, which is insufficient for users desiring more nuanced categorization (e.g., by mood, energy level, specific sub-genres, or era).
*   **Metadata Inconsistencies:** Music files often have incomplete, incorrect, or inconsistent metadata, leading to disorganized libraries even within basic sorting structures.
*   **Rediscovery Challenges:** Users often forget about or lose track of older songs within their large collections, leading to repetitive listening patterns and missed opportunities for rediscovery.
*   **Inefficient Playlist Creation:** Manually curating playlists from large, unorganized libraries is a laborious process.

These pain points culminate in a disjointed and inefficient listening experience, hindering users from fully appreciating and interacting with their music.

## 3. Target Audience

The primary target audience for HarmonyFlow consists of **individuals with large digital music libraries (e.g., 500+ tracks) who are passionate about music and seek an intuitive, efficient, and intelligent way to organize and access their tracks.**

**Key characteristics and motivations include:**

*   **Music Enthusiasts:** People who actively collect music, have diverse tastes, and value their personal collections.
*   **Frustrated Organizers:** Users who are currently overwhelmed by the sheer volume of their music and find existing organizational tools inadequate.
*   **Efficiency Seekers:** Individuals who prioritize quick access to specific music based on various criteria beyond standard metadata.
*   **Explorers and Rediscoverers:** Users interested in uncovering hidden gems within their own libraries and experiencing their music in new, thematic ways.
*   **Tech-Savvy Adaptors:** Early adopters who are open to leveraging AI to enhance their digital experiences.

Their goal is to transform their chaotic music collections into highly organized, easily navigable, and enjoyable personal archives, allowing for spontaneous listening and deep dives into specific moods, genres, or activities.
