# Product Requirements Document: Monkey Sighting Tracker App

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for the "Monkey Sighting Tracker App," a mobile application designed to revolutionize how zoos monitor and manage their monkey populations. The primary purpose of this project is to create an efficient, accurate, and real-time system for recording monkey sightings within designated zoo areas. By leveraging modern mobile technology, the app aims to provide zoo management, keepers, and researchers with reliable data essential for animal welfare, inventory management, and scientific research efforts.

## 2. Problem Statement

Zoos face significant challenges in accurately and efficiently monitoring their diverse animal populations, particularly highly mobile and numerous species like monkeys. Current manual counting methods are fraught with inefficiencies and inaccuracies:

*   **Time-consuming & Laborious:** Zoo keepers spend considerable time physically counting monkeys, often taking away from other critical animal care duties.
*   **Prone to Inaccuracies:** Animal movement, large and complex enclosures, environmental factors (e.g., dense foliage), and the presence of multiple individuals or species make precise manual counting extremely difficult and error-prone.
*   **Delayed Data & Analysis:** Manual records (paper logs, basic spreadsheets) require additional time for data entry and aggregation, delaying insights and proactive management decisions.
*   **Lack of Real-time Visibility:** Management often lacks immediate access to current population data, hindering rapid response to welfare concerns or unexpected population changes.
*   **Inconsistent Data Quality:** Variances in counting methodologies among different staff members can lead to inconsistent data, complicating long-term trend analysis and research.

These pain points directly impact animal welfare monitoring, resource allocation, and the validity of research outcomes, creating a critical need for a more streamlined and accurate solution.

    *   **Motivations:** To obtain reliable, granular, and longitudinal data for their studies, contributing to scientific understanding and conservation efforts.
    *   **Goals:** Easily retrieve historical sighting data, analyze population trends, correlate sightings with other environmental or behavioral factors, and conduct species-specific research.
*   **Zoo Management (Secondary Users):**
    *   **Description:** Directors, curators, and department heads responsible for overall zoo operations, resource allocation, and strategic planning.
    *   **Motivations:** To ensure efficient operations, make data-driven decisions regarding animal exhibits and resources, and maintain compliance with regulatory bodies.
    *   **Goals:** Gain high-level overviews of monkey populations, access aggregated reports for planning and budgeting, and monitor operational efficiency.

## 4. Goals/Objectives

Our goals are designed to be Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound (SMART), ensuring clear objectives for success.

**Business Goals:**

*   **Efficiency Enhancement:** Reduce the average time spent on manual monkey counting by 50% for zoo keepers within 6 months of the app's full deployment.
*   **Data Accuracy:** Achieve a 95% accuracy rate in recorded monkey population counts compared to periodic independent audits within 3 months of deployment.
*   **Operational Insight:** Provide zoo management with weekly aggregated, real-time reports on monkey populations to inform resource allocation and exhibit planning decisions effectively.

**User Goals:**

*   **Ease of Use:** Enable zoo staff to successfully record a monkey sighting (from app open to submission) within 15 seconds, 90% of the time, within 1 month of training.
*   **Data Accessibility:** Allow researchers and animal welfare staff to retrieve historical monkey sighting data for any enclosure or species within 5 seconds via the web dashboard.
*   **Reliability:** Ensure 99.9% uptime for the mobile application and backend services during zoo operational hours.

## 5. Features & Requirements

This section details the core features of the Monkey Sighting Tracker App, outlining their functionality and importance.

### 5.1. Monkey Sighting Recording

*   **Description:** The foundational feature allowing users to log observed monkey populations in specific locations.
*   **Functional Requirements:**
    *   Users can select a designated enclosure or area from a predefined, searchable list.
    *   Users can input the number of monkeys sighted.
    *   Users can optionally select the specific monkey species (if multiple species are present in the enclosure/zoo).
    *   Users can optionally add text-based notes or observations (e.g., notable behavior, health status of an individual).
    *   The app will automatically timestamp each record and associate it with the logged-in user.
    *   Offline mode: Users can record sightings without immediate internet access, with data syncing once connectivity is restored.
*   **Importance:** This is the core data collection mechanism, directly addressing the inefficiency and inaccuracy of manual counting.

### 5.2. Real-time Location Tracking & Mapping

*   **Description:** Leverage location services to assist users in identifying their current enclosure and visualize sighting distribution.
