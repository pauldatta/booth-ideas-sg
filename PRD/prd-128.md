# Product Requirements Document: AutoPark Navigator

## 1. Introduction

AutoPark Navigator is a pioneering mobile application designed to alleviate the common frustration of forgetting where one has parked their car. Leveraging advanced smartphone location services and intelligent algorithms, this app aims to automatically detect when a user parks their vehicle, log the precise location, and provide intuitive tools for manual refinement of parking details (e.g., floor, section). The core purpose is to offer car owners a seamless, stress-free experience, ensuring they can always quickly and confidently locate their parked car, thereby saving time and reducing anxiety.

## 2. Problem Statement

In an increasingly urbanized world, drivers frequently encounter large, complex parking environments such as expansive outdoor lots, multi-story garages, and unfamiliar city streets. The simple act of parking a car can often lead to a significant source of stress and wasted time when the driver later struggles to remember their exact parking spot. This problem is exacerbated by: 

*   **Cognitive Load**: Drivers are often distracted or in a hurry when parking, leading to poor recall.
*   **Complex Environments**: Multi-level garages with similar-looking floors and sections, or vast outdoor lots without distinctive landmarks, make it challenging to establish and remember a unique location marker.
*   **Time Sensitivity**: Forgetting a parking spot can lead to missed appointments, delayed departures, or even incurring additional parking fees, creating significant frustration and anxiety.
*   **Lack of a Reliable System**: Current manual methods (e.g., taking a photo, writing it down) are inconsistent and prone to human error or oversight.

This product aims to provide a robust, automated solution to this prevalent problem, enhancing the daily lives of car owners.

## 3. Target Audience

The primary target audience for AutoPark Navigator comprises car owners who frequently park in extensive outdoor lots, multi-level garages, or unfamiliar areas and desire a simple, reliable way to remember their parking spot. This includes, but is not limited to:

*   **Daily Commuters**: Those who park in large office complexes, public transportation hubs, or university campuses.
*   **Shoppers**: Individuals who frequent large retail centers, malls, or outlet villages with extensive parking structures.
*   **Event Attendees**: People attending concerts, sports events, or conferences where parking is often in vast, temporary, or unfamiliar lots.
*   **Travelers**: Individuals who park their cars at airports, train stations, or hotels for extended periods.
*   **Rent-a-Car Users**: Those unfamiliar with a rental vehicle or a new city, needing help tracking their temporary vehicle's location.

Motivations for these users include: valuing efficiency and time-saving, seeking to reduce daily stress and anxiety, appreciating technological convenience, and desiring greater peace of mind knowing their car's location is securely logged.

## 5. Features & Requirements

### 5.1. Automatic Parking Location Tracking
*   **Description**: The app will automatically detect when the user has parked their car and log the precise GPS coordinates. This detection will rely on a combination of factors, including cessation of vehicle movement (via accelerometer/gyroscope data), disconnect from car's Bluetooth/Apple CarPlay/Android Auto, and changes in Wi-Fi networks (e.g., disconnecting from car's hotspot, connecting to public Wi-Fi at a parking garage). 
*   **Functional Requirements**: 
    *   R1.1: The app shall accurately log the user's GPS coordinates within a 5-meter radius upon vehicle stoppage detection.
    *   R1.2: The app shall support detection via Bluetooth disconnection, accelerometer/gyroscope data analysis, and Wi-Fi network changes.
    *   R1.3: The app shall operate reliably in the background without excessive battery drain.
    *   R1.4: The app shall present a notification to the user confirming the parking event and providing a quick link to view/edit the location.
*   **Importance**: This is the core innovative feature, providing effortless and automated tracking, fulfilling the primary problem statement.

### 5.2. Manual Parking Details Input
*   **Description**: Users can manually add or edit details about their parking spot, such as floor number, section, specific row/pillar identification, and even attach a photo or a voice memo. This enhances accuracy in complex environments like multi-story garages.
*   **Functional Requirements**: 
    *   R2.1: Users shall be able to input text for floor, section, or descriptive notes.
    *   R2.2: Users shall be able to attach one or more photos to a parking location.
    *   R2.3: Users shall be able to record a short voice memo for additional context.
    *   R2.4: Manual inputs shall override or augment automatically detected information.
*   **Importance**: Addresses the limitations of GPS in covered areas and allows for critical context that GPS alone cannot provide.
