# Product Requirements Document: Pantry Chef

## 1. Introduction

The Pantry Chef application is a mobile-first solution designed to revolutionize home cooking and significantly reduce food waste. At its core, it provides intelligent recipe suggestions based on ingredients users currently have on hand. This document outlines the vision, scope, and requirements for the initial release of Pantry Chef, aiming to empower home cooks with creativity, efficiency, and sustainability in their kitchens.

## 2. Problem Statement

Home cooks frequently face a two-fold challenge: a lack of inspiration for meals and the subsequent waste of unused ingredients. This leads to several pain points:

*   **Food Waste:** Perishable ingredients often expire before they can be used, contributing to significant household food waste and financial loss.
*   **Decision Fatigue:** Users spend excessive time trying to decide what to cook, often resulting in repetitive meals or resorting to takeout.
*   **Ingredient Underutilization:** Many ingredients purchased for specific recipes are left partially used, sitting in the pantry or fridge without a clear purpose.
*   **Limited Culinary Repertoire:** Cooks often stick to familiar recipes, missing out on opportunities to experiment with new dishes using existing ingredients.
*   **Grocery Bill Inefficiency:** Unplanned purchases or forgotten ingredients lead to inefficient grocery shopping and higher overall food expenditure.

Pantry Chef directly addresses these pain points by transforming the chaotic task of meal planning into an intuitive, inspiring, and economical experience.
