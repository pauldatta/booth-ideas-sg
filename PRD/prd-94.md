# Product Requirements Document: Smart Sticky Notes with Timers

## 1. Introduction

The Smart Sticky Notes with Timers application aims to revolutionize personal productivity by integrating time management directly into task capture. Traditional sticky notes, while effective for quick idea capture, lack the crucial element of time tracking, leading to missed deadlines and poor focus. This product addresses that gap by providing a mobile application where users can create digital sticky notes, each equipped with a customizable, integrated timer. Our goal is to empower users to better manage their time, maintain focus on individual tasks, and ultimately improve their task completion rates and overall productivity.

## 2. Problem Statement

In today's fast-paced environment, individuals across various domains—from students juggling assignments to professionals managing multiple projects—frequently struggle with effective time management and maintaining focus on specific tasks. The core pain points include:

*   **Lack of Integrated Time Awareness:** Existing note-taking solutions are often disconnected from time-tracking tools, forcing users to switch between applications or rely on manual, imprecise methods (like glancing at a clock). This cognitive overhead disrupts flow and reduces efficiency.
*   **Difficulty in Prioritization & Deadline Adherence:** Without clear visual indicators of time allocated or remaining for a task, users find it challenging to prioritize effectively and adhere to self-imposed or external deadlines. Tasks often take longer than anticipated due to a lack of timeboxing.
*   **Distraction and Procrastination:** The absence of a clear, active timer can lead to increased distractions and procrastination. When tasks feel open-ended, it's easier to lose focus or defer work, especially for complex or less engaging activities.
*   **Inefficient Task Breakdown:** Users often tackle large tasks without breaking them down into manageable, time-bound chunks, leading to overwhelm and reduced momentum.
*   **Inability to Analyze Time Usage:** Without a system to track time spent per task, users lack valuable data to understand their productivity patterns, identify time sinks, and refine their time management strategies.

This application seeks to alleviate these pain points by providing a seamless, integrated solution for task capture and time management.
