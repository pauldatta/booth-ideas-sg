# Coin Counter Mobile Application PRD

## 1. Introduction

The Coin Counter Mobile Application is designed to revolutionize the way individuals and small businesses manage their loose change. This product aims to provide a fast, accurate, and convenient solution for counting physical coins by leveraging advanced mobile camera technology and artificial intelligence. The primary goal is to eliminate the tedious, time-consuming, and error-prone process of manual coin counting, thereby saving users time and ensuring financial precision.

## 2. Problem Statement

Manually counting large quantities of physical coins presents several significant pain points:

*   **Tedious and Time-Consuming:** Whether it's a personal coin jar or a business's daily till, sifting through and counting hundreds or thousands of coins is a labor-intensive process that can consume valuable time for both individuals and employees.
*   **Prone to Human Error:** Fatigue, distractions, or simply miscounting can lead to inaccuracies, resulting in incorrect financial totals. For businesses, this can impact daily reconciliation and banking; for individuals, it can lead to underestimation of savings.
*   **Inefficiency for Businesses:** Small businesses (e.g., laundromats, retail stores, restaurants) often deal with significant amounts of coin transactions. The time spent by staff on manual counting could be better utilized elsewhere, affecting operational efficiency and profitability.
*   **Lack of Accessibility:** Physical coin counting machines are often costly, bulky, and not readily available for individual use, leaving manual counting as the only alternative for many.

This application seeks to directly address these challenges by automating the counting process, making it accessible to anyone with a smartphone.
