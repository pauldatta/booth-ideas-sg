# Product Requirements Document: Personal Wine Cellar Manager (Code Name: "Vinventory")

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for "Vinventory," a comprehensive mobile application designed to empower wine enthusiasts and casual drinkers to effortlessly manage their personal wine collections. The project aims to solve the pervasive problem of forgotten bottles, duplicate purchases, and suboptimal wine consumption by providing a user-friendly, intelligent platform for tracking, organizing, and interacting with one's wine inventory.

## 2. Problem Statement

Wine collecting, whether a serious hobby or a casual accumulation, often leads to disorganization and frustration. Individuals with wine collections frequently struggle with several pain points:

*   **Lack of Inventory Visibility:** Users often forget what wines they own, leading to duplicate purchases of bottles they already possess or, conversely, failing to acquire desirable wines before they become unavailable.
*   **Poor Organization:** Bottles are frequently stored in various locations (cellars, fridges, cabinets) without a centralized system to track their physical whereabouts, making it difficult to locate specific wines when desired.
*   **Suboptimal Consumption:** Without knowing a wine's optimal drinking window, bottles may be consumed too early, before reaching their peak, or too late, after they have passed their prime, resulting in a diminished wine experience or even spoilage.
*   **Cumbersome Manual Tracking:** Current methods often involve manual spreadsheets, notebooks, or memory, which are prone to errors, time-consuming to maintain, and lack dynamic search or analytical capabilities.
*   **Missed Enjoyment:** The inability to easily access information about one's collection (e.g., tasting notes, purchase history, recommended pairings) reduces the overall enjoyment and appreciation of the wines owned.

"Vinventory" seeks to eliminate these challenges, transforming wine collection management from a chore into an enjoyable, insightful, and effortless experience.
