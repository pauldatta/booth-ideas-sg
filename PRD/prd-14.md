# Product Requirements Document: Ingredient-Based Recipe Generator

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a new mobile application designed to empower users to efficiently utilize the ingredients they currently have on hand. The primary goal is to minimize food waste, reduce repetitive meal planning, and simplify the daily cooking experience for home cooks and busy individuals. By leveraging advanced Artificial intelligence (AI), the application will provide instant, personalized recipe suggestions based on a user's available ingredients, transforming how people approach meal preparation.

## 2. Problem Statement

Many individuals face a common dilemma: a refrigerator full of ingredients but an empty mind when it comes to meal ideas. This leads to significant pain points:

*   **Food Waste:** Perishable ingredients often expire before they can be used, contributing to considerable household food waste and financial loss.
*   **Meal Repetition/Boredom:** Without inspiration, users often fall back on a small repertoire of familiar dishes, leading to culinary monotony.
*   **Inefficient Grocery Usage:** Users frequently buy new ingredients for specific recipes, neglecting existing pantry staples.
*   **Time Consumption:** Brainstorming meals, checking ingredient lists, and searching for suitable recipes is a time-consuming and often frustrating process.
*   **Lack of Inspiration:** Traditional recipe apps often require users to search for a dish they *want* to make, rather than suggesting dishes based on *what they have*.

This application directly addresses these challenges by shifting the paradigm from 'what do I want to cook?' to 'what can I cook with what I have?'.

## 3. Target Audience
