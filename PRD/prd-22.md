# Product Requirements Document: Singapore Dog-Friendly Park Finder App

## 1. Introduction
This document outlines the requirements for a mobile application designed to help dog owners in Singapore easily locate and discover dog-friendly parks. The primary goal is to enhance the quality of life for both dogs and their owners by providing a centralized, reliable, and user-friendly resource for suitable outdoor spaces. This application aims to address the growing demand for pet-welcoming public areas in Singapore, fostering a more informed and engaged dog-owning community.

## 2. Problem Statement
Dog ownership in Singapore is on the rise, yet dog owners frequently encounter significant challenges when trying to find appropriate and verified dog-friendly parks. The current landscape is fragmented; information is scattered across various unofficial forums, outdated websites, or requires word-of-mouth recommendations. This lack of a centralized, reliable, and easy-to-use resource leads to several pain points:

*   **Uncertainty and Frustration:** Owners often arrive at parks only to find out they are not dog-friendly, leading to wasted time and disappointment.
*   **Limited Discovery:** Many owners are unaware of the full range of dog-friendly parks available to them, limiting their options for exercise and socialization.
*   **Lack of Detailed Information:** Existing resources rarely provide comprehensive details such as specific off-leash areas, water points, shade availability, or whether the park is fenced, which are crucial for a safe and enjoyable visit.
*   **Safety Concerns:** Without verified information, owners may unknowingly take their dogs to unsuitable or potentially unsafe environments.
*   **Difficulty Planning:** Spontaneous outings are difficult to plan when accurate information is not readily accessible.
