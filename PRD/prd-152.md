# Product Requirements Document: Hotel Gym Check-in Application

## 1. Introduction
This document outlines the requirements for a new iPad application designed to streamline the check-in and check-out process for hotel guests using the on-site gym facility. The primary goal is to replace manual, often paper-based, systems with an efficient, digital solution that enhances the guest experience, improves operational efficiency for the hotel, and provides valuable data for management.

## 2. Problem Statement
Currently, hotel visitors face an often inconvenient and inefficient method for checking into and out of the gym. This can involve signing in on paper logs at the front desk or directly at the gym, leading to several pain points:

*   **For Guests:** Tedious manual entry, potential waiting times, lack of privacy for personal data visible on paper logs, and a perception of outdated service.
*   **For Hotel Operations:** Manual processes are time-consuming for staff, prone to errors (illegible handwriting, forgotten entries), and create a significant administrative burden. There is no real-time visibility into gym occupancy.
*   **For Security & Compliance:** Manual logs offer poor data integrity, making it difficult to accurately track who is in the gym at any given time, posing security risks and challenges for capacity management and audit compliance.
*   **Lack of Insights:** Without digital data, hotels cannot easily analyze gym usage patterns, peak times, or overall facility utilization, hindering data-driven decisions for resource allocation, maintenance, and facility improvements.

## 3. Target Audience
