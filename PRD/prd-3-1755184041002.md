# Product Requirements Document: Ingredient-Based Recipe Suggester

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a mobile application designed to revolutionize home cooking by providing personalized recipe suggestions based on ingredients users currently have on hand. The primary goal is to empower users to efficiently utilize their existing pantry contents, significantly reduce food waste, and simplify daily meal preparation. By leveraging advanced AI, this application aims to transform the often daunting task of 'what to cook' into an inspiring and efficient experience, fostering culinary creativity while promoting sustainable practices.

## 2. Problem Statement

Home cooks frequently face a pervasive challenge: deciding what to prepare given their current pantry contents. This often leads to significant pain points:

*   **Food Waste:** Perishable ingredients, purchased with good intentions, often go unused and spoil because users lack inspiration or a clear plan for their consumption. This translates to financial loss and environmental impact.
*   **Repetitive Meals:** Without fresh ideas or a systematic way to explore ingredient combinations, users tend to fall back on a limited repertoire of familiar dishes, leading to culinary boredom and a feeling of stagnation in their cooking.
*   **Time and Mental Load:** The process of brainstorming recipes, checking ingredients, and planning meals can be time-consuming and mentally exhausting, especially after a long day.
*   **Limited Inspiration:** Traditional recipe apps often require users to search for specific dishes, rather than providing suggestions based on what's available, limiting spontaneous and ingredient-driven cooking.
*   **Ingredient Overwhelm:** A fridge full of disparate ingredients can feel overwhelming, making it harder to envision cohesive meals and increasing the likelihood of takeout or delivery.
