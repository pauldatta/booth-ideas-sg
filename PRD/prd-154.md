# Product Requirements Document: NutriScan - AI-Powered Meal Nutrition Analyzer

## 1. Introduction

This Product Requirements Document (PRD) outlines the development of NutriScan, an innovative mobile application designed to simplify and automate the process of tracking meal nutrition. Leveraging advanced Artificial Intelligence (AI) and computer vision, NutriScan will allow users to simply take a photo of their meal and instantly receive a detailed nutritional breakdown. The primary goal is to empower health-conscious individuals and dieters with effortless, accurate insights into their dietary habits, enabling them to make informed food choices and achieve their health and wellness objectives.

## 2. Problem Statement

Many individuals recognize the importance of monitoring their nutritional intake for health, fitness, or dietary management purposes. However, the existing methods for tracking meals are often cumbersome, time-consuming, and prone to inaccuracies, leading to significant user frustration and inconsistent data logging. Pain points include:

*   **Manual Data Entry Fatigue:** Users find it tedious and disruptive to manually search for food items, estimate portion sizes, and log every ingredient for each meal.
*   **Inaccuracy and Inconsistency:** Estimating portion sizes or identifying specific ingredients without expert knowledge often leads to incorrect nutritional data, undermining the purpose of tracking.
*   **Lack of Real-time Insight:** Current tracking methods often require significant effort before providing useful insights, making it difficult for users to make immediate, informed decisions about their next meal.
*   **Barrier to Entry for New Users:** The steep learning curve and perceived complexity of traditional diet tracking apps deter potential users from adopting consistent nutritional monitoring.
*   **Limited Food Recognition:** Many apps struggle with complex meals, mixed dishes, or international cuisines, requiring extensive manual input.

These challenges result in low user engagement, high drop-off rates, and ultimately, users failing to consistently track their nutrition and achieve their health goals.
