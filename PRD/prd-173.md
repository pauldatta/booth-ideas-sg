# Product Requirements Document: Real-time Bus Commuter Feedback Analysis System

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a novel application designed to revolutionize how the Land Transport Authority (LTA) monitors and improves its bus services. The system will leverage artificial intelligence to analyze real-time commuter feedback, automatically identifying pain points and generating actionable reports for specific bus routes. The primary objective is to empower LTA officials with immediate, data-driven insights, facilitating more responsive and efficient bus service enhancements, ultimately leading to increased commuter satisfaction and operational excellence.

## 2. Problem Statement

The LTA currently faces significant challenges in efficiently analyzing the vast volume of bus commuter feedback it receives. The existing methods for collecting, processing, and interpreting feedback are largely manual, fragmented, and time-consuming. This leads to several critical pain points:

*   **Delayed Insights**: Manual aggregation and categorization of feedback from various channels (e.g., social media, call centers, website forms) create a substantial time lag, preventing prompt identification and resolution of emerging issues.
*   **Inefficient Resource Allocation**: Without real-time, consolidated insights, LTA operations managers struggle to prioritize and allocate resources effectively to address recurring or critical service problems.
*   **Lack of Granularity**: It is difficult to quickly pinpoint specific issues affecting individual bus routes, making targeted improvements challenging.
*   **Subjectivity and Bias**: Manual review processes can introduce subjectivity and inconsistencies in interpreting feedback, leading to less objective decision-making.
*   **Missed Opportunities**: The inability to swiftly detect trends or sudden spikes in negative sentiment means missed opportunities for proactive intervention and service optimization.
*   **High Operational Costs**: Extensive manual effort is required to process feedback, diverting resources that could be better utilized for service planning and implementation.

These issues collectively hinder the LTA's ability to maintain high service standards, respond promptly to commuter needs, and proactively enhance the public bus network.

## 3. Target Audience

The primary users of this application are LTA officials and operations managers responsible for the oversight, monitoring, and improvement of public bus services. Specifically:

*   **LTA Operations Managers**: Responsible for the day-to-day smooth running of bus services. Their motivation is to quickly identify and resolve operational issues, minimize disruptions, and maintain high service quality. Their goal is to have a clear, real-time picture of service performance and commuter sentiment to make rapid, informed decisions.
*   **LTA Route Planners & Service Improvement Leads**: Focused on long-term planning, route optimization, and implementing service enhancements. Their motivation is to identify systemic issues, evaluate the impact of changes, and design more efficient and commuter-friendly routes. Their goal is to access detailed, historical, and trend-based feedback analysis to inform strategic decisions.
*   **LTA Customer Service & Feedback Teams**: Responsible for managing commuter feedback and addressing individual complaints. Their motivation is to quickly identify common complaint themes and potentially direct commuters to self-help resources or inform them of ongoing service improvements. Their goal is to streamline feedback categorization and understand the broader impact of reported issues.

These users are motivated by a desire to provide world-class public transportation, ensure commuter satisfaction, and leverage data to achieve operational excellence. They seek a tool that reduces manual effort, provides actionable insights, and supports data-driven decision-making.

## 4. Goals/Objectives

This project aims to achieve the following specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART) goals:

**Business Goals:**

*   **Operational Efficiency**: Reduce the average time taken for LTA officials to identify actionable service improvement opportunities from raw commuter feedback by 50% within 6 months of the system's full deployment.
*   **Commuter Satisfaction**: Contribute to an increase in overall commuter satisfaction scores (as measured by LTA's internal surveys) for targeted bus routes by 10% within 12 months of deployment.
*   **Cost Reduction**: Decrease operational costs associated with manual feedback processing and analysis by 30% within 1 year by automating key tasks.
*   **Data-Driven Decision Making**: Establish the platform as the primary source for real-time commuter sentiment and feedback analysis for all bus service optimization decisions within 9 months.

**User Goals:**

*   Provide LTA operations managers with immediate, real-time insights into bus service issues and commuter sentiment for specific routes.
*   Automate the generation of comprehensive, actionable reports on potential service improvements, reducing manual report creation time.
*   Offer a user-friendly and intuitive interface for easy navigation, filtering, and analysis of feedback data and report history.

## 5. Features & Requirements

### 5.1 Real-time Feedback Ingestion

*   **Description**: The system will continuously collect unstructured commuter feedback from multiple LTA-approved sources, including existing LTA mobile applications, website forms, social media platforms (e.g., Twitter, Facebook comments relevant to LTA pages), and digitized call center transcripts.
*   **Requirements**: 
    *   Support API integrations for pulling data from LTA's existing feedback channels.
    *   Ability to monitor and ingest public posts/comments mentioning LTA and relevant keywords on specified social media platforms.
    *   Handle various data formats (text, transcribed audio).
    *   Ensure data freshness with near real-time ingestion (latency < 5 minutes).
*   **Importance**: Ensures a comprehensive and up-to-date dataset for analysis, preventing blind spots and enabling timely responses.

### 5.2 AI-Powered Sentiment Analysis

*   **Description**: Utilizes advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) models to automatically analyze the emotional tone and intensity of each piece of commuter feedback (e.g., positive, negative, neutral, very negative).
*   **Requirements**: 
    *   High accuracy (>85% F1-score) in classifying sentiment, especially for Singaporean English nuances and local colloquialisms.
    *   Ability to detect sarcasm and nuanced negative feedback.
    *   Provide a sentiment score or confidence level for each classification.
*   **Importance**: Quantifies the emotional impact of feedback, helping to prioritize issues based on severity and urgency.

### 5.3 Topic Extraction & Categorization

*   **Description**: Employs AI algorithms to identify and extract key topics, themes, and entities mentioned in the feedback, categorizing them into predefined or automatically discovered categories (e.g.,
