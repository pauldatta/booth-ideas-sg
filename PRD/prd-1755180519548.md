# Product Requirements Document: Ingredient-Based Recipe Suggester App

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a mobile application designed to revolutionize home cooking and combat food waste. The "Ingredient-Based Recipe Suggester" app aims to provide users with a dynamic and intelligent tool that generates recipe suggestions based on the ingredients they currently possess. By leveraging advanced AI, the application will empower users to efficiently utilize their existing pantry contents, significantly reduce food waste, and simplify daily meal preparation, transforming a common kitchen challenge into an opportunity for culinary creativity and resourcefulness.

## 2. Problem Statement

Many home cooks frequently face the dilemma of an overflowing pantry and refrigerator, yet struggle to decide what to cook. This often leads to ingredients going unused and eventually being discarded, contributing to significant food waste. The core pain points include:

*   **Difficulty in Recipe Discovery:** Existing recipe platforms often require users to search for specific dishes, rather than starting with available ingredients. This makes it challenging to find recipes that *exclusively* use what's on hand.
*   **Food Waste:** Perishable ingredients expire or spoil before they can be used, leading to financial loss and environmental impact.
*   **Inefficient Meal Planning:** Cooks spend excessive time brainstorming meals or making unplanned grocery runs for just one or two missing ingredients.
*   **Lack of Inspiration:** Users often fall into a routine of cooking the same dishes, limited by their immediate knowledge of how to combine various ingredients.

These challenges result in frustration, increased household expenditure on groceries that go to waste, and a missed opportunity to fully leverage existing food resources.
