# Product Requirements Document: Warehouse Picking Route Optimization App

## 1. Introduction
This document outlines the requirements for a small mobile application designed to optimize material picking routes within a warehouse environment. The primary goal is to enhance operational efficiency by generating the most effective picking paths, thereby reducing travel time, minimizing errors, and accelerating order fulfillment. This application leverages advanced algorithms to provide dynamic, intelligent routing solutions tailored to specific order lists and real-time warehouse conditions.

## 2. Problem Statement
Warehouse material picking is a critical yet often inefficient process. Many warehouses currently operate with manual, static, or sub-optimal route planning, leading to significant challenges:

*   **Wasted Time and Resources**: Pickers spend excessive time traversing the warehouse, often backtracking or taking unnecessarily long routes due to poor planning or lack of real-time guidance. This directly translates to increased labor costs and reduced productivity.
*   **Reduced Efficiency**: Static routes fail to adapt to dynamic inventory changes, new order priorities, or temporary obstructions, leading to further delays and the need for on-the-fly, often sub-optimal, decisions by pickers.
*   **Increased Errors**: Inefficient routing can contribute to picking errors as pickers might rush, become fatigued, or struggle to locate items quickly, impacting order accuracy and customer satisfaction.
*   **Higher Operational Costs**: The cumulative effect of wasted time, reduced efficiency, and picking errors contributes to higher operational costs, including labor, fuel (for vehicles), and potential returns.
*   **Slower Order Fulfillment**: The inability to quickly and efficiently fulfill orders directly impacts delivery times, customer experience, and overall business competitiveness.

This application aims to directly address these pain points by introducing intelligent, dynamic route optimization.

## 3. Target Audience
The primary target users for this application are:

*   **Warehouse Material Pickers**: These are the frontline personnel responsible for locating and retrieving items from various warehouse locations to fulfill customer orders. Their motivations include completing tasks quickly, minimizing physical effort, reducing errors, and meeting daily targets. They need an intuitive, reliable tool that simplifies their job.
*   **Warehouse Supervisors/Managers**: These users oversee daily picking operations, manage picker assignments, monitor performance, and are responsible for overall warehouse efficiency and cost control. Their goals include maximizing throughput, optimizing resource allocation, improving team productivity, and ensuring operational excellence. They need data and insights to make informed decisions.

Secondary users may include Inventory Managers and Logistics Planners who benefit from improved data accuracy and overall operational flow.

## 4. Goals/Objectives
Our key objectives for the Warehouse Picking Route Optimization App are specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART):

*   **Improve Picking Efficiency**: Reduce average picker travel time per order by **20%** within six months of deployment.
*   **Reduce Operational Costs**: Decrease labor costs associated with picking by **15%** within the first year, primarily by improving efficiency.
*   **Increase Order Fulfillment Speed**: Accelerate the average order fulfillment time by **25%** within nine months of deployment, leading to faster customer delivery.
*   **Enhance User Satisfaction**: Achieve an average picker satisfaction score of **4.5 out of 5** (on a standard survey) within three months of deployment, reflecting ease of use and perceived value.
*   **Ensure Data Accuracy**: Maintain route generation accuracy with less than **1%** discrepancy from optimal paths, verified through simulations and real-world trials.

## 5. Features & Requirements

### 5.1 Order List Management
*   **Description**: Allows for the import of picking lists from existing Warehouse Management Systems (WMS) or manual entry of individual orders. The system should be able to handle single-order and multi-order batch picking requests.
*   **Importance**: This is the foundational input for the route optimization engine, ensuring that all items needing to be picked are accurately captured.
*   **Functional Requirements**: 
    *   `FR-OL-001`: System shall support CSV/JSON import of pick lists, including item ID, quantity, and specified storage location.
    *   `FR-OL-002`: System shall allow manual creation and modification of pick lists.
    *   `FR-OL-003`: System shall support batching multiple orders into a single picking run based on user-defined criteria (e.g., proximity, order priority).

### 5.2 Warehouse Layout Configuration
*   **Description**: Provides tools for defining and managing the physical layout of the warehouse, including aisles, racks, bin locations, and any potential obstacles or one-way paths. This can involve graphical mapping or data-driven input.
*   **Importance**: Accurate layout data is crucial for the route optimization algorithm to calculate the most efficient and practical paths.
*   **Functional Requirements**: 
    *   `FR-WL-001`: System shall allow definition of warehouse zones, aisles, and specific bin locations (e.g., Aisle 1, Rack B, Shelf 3, Bin 12).
    *   `FR-WL-002`: System shall support marking one-way aisles, restricted areas, and temporary obstructions.
    *   `FR-WL-003`: System shall allow updates to the layout to reflect changes in inventory storage or facility modifications.

### 5.3 AI-Powered Route Optimization Engine
*   **Description**: The core intelligence of the application. This engine will take the order list and warehouse layout to generate the most efficient picking path(s). It will consider factors like shortest distance, fewest turns, item proximity, and potentially real-time inventory levels.
*   **Importance**: Directly addresses the problem of suboptimal routing, delivering the primary value proposition of efficiency and time-saving.
*   **Functional Requirements**: 
    *   `FR-RO-001`: System shall calculate the shortest possible route to collect all items on a given pick list.
    *   `FR-RO-002`: System shall consider one-way paths, obstacles, and preferred travel routes in its calculations.
    *   `FR-RO-003`: System shall provide options for different optimization strategies (e.g.,
