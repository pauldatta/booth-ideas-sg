# Product Requirements Document: Unified TV Program App

## 1. Introduction

The Unified TV Program App project aims to revolutionize the way users discover, track, and engage with television content. In an increasingly fragmented media landscape, viewers often struggle to navigate complex schedules across traditional broadcast channels and a myriad of streaming services. This application will serve as a single, intuitive hub, providing a personalized and comprehensive guide to all available TV programs, thereby simplifying content discovery and enhancing the overall viewing experience. Our primary objective is to make finding and enjoying TV content effortless and enjoyable for everyone.

## 2. Problem Statement

The modern television viewing experience is plagued by significant pain points, leading to frustration and missed opportunities for content consumption:

*   **Fragmented Content Landscape**: Content is scattered across dozens of broadcast channels, cable providers, and an ever-growing number of streaming platforms (Netflix, Hulu, Disney+, Amazon Prime Video, etc.). Users must switch between multiple apps and interfaces to find desired shows.
*   **Inefficient Content Discovery**: Without a centralized guide, users rely on channel surfing, social media recommendations, or laborious manual searches to find something to watch. This is time-consuming and often leads to missing out on relevant or new content.
*   **Difficulty Tracking Schedules**: Keeping up with broadcast times, new episode releases, and season premieres across different services is a significant challenge. Users frequently miss shows due to forgetting air times or being unaware of their availability.
*   **Information Overload**: While many platforms offer recommendations, they are often confined to their own content library. Users need a holistic view that transcends individual services and provides truly personalized, cross-platform suggestions.
*   **Lack of Personalization Across Platforms**: Existing guides or apps rarely consider a user's comprehensive viewing history or preferences across all their subscribed services and live TV habits.

These issues collectively detract from the enjoyment of watching TV, leading to user fatigue and a less engaging entertainment experience.

## 3. Target Audience

Our primary target audience is broad, encompassing anyone who regularly watches television content, regardless of their primary consumption method (live TV, cable, or streaming services). This includes, but is not limited to:

*   **The Casual Viewer**: Someone who watches TV regularly but struggles with what to watch, seeking easy discovery and personalized suggestions. They want to avoid endless scrolling and quickly find something enjoyable for a specific mood or time slot.
*   **The Dedicated Fan**: Individuals who follow specific shows, genres, or actors intently. They need reliable reminders and a centralized way to track their favorite series across seasons and platforms, ensuring they never miss an episode.
*   **The Multi-Service Subscriber**: Users who subscribe to multiple streaming services and/or have a cable TV package. They are overwhelmed by the need to check numerous apps and guides and desire a single, unified interface for all their content.
*   **The Tech-Savvy User**: Those who appreciate efficiency and smart technology solutions. They are open to AI-powered recommendations and desire an intuitive, streamlined user experience.

**Motivations and Goals of the Target Audience:**

*   **Save Time**: Reduce the time spent searching for content.
*   **Discover New Content**: Find shows and movies tailored to their interests that they might not have otherwise found.
*   **Stay Organized**: Easily track shows, set reminders, and manage their viewing schedule.
*   **Reduce Frustration**: Eliminate the need to juggle multiple apps and interfaces.
*   **Enhance Enjoyment**: Make the overall TV viewing experience more seamless and enjoyable.
