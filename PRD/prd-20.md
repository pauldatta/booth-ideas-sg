# Product Requirements Document: PawPark Singapore

## 1. Introduction

PawPark Singapore is a mobile application designed to revolutionize how dog owners in Singapore discover and access dog-friendly parks. This product aims to create a centralized, reliable, and user-friendly platform that empowers dog owners to easily locate suitable recreational spaces for their canine companions, thereby enhancing pet well-being, fostering social interaction, and promoting responsible dog ownership within the community.

## 2. Problem Statement

Dog ownership in Singapore is on the rise, yet a significant challenge persists for owners: efficiently identifying and locating certified dog-friendly parks that cater to their specific needs and ensure their pets' safety. The current landscape is fragmented, with information often scattered across various government websites, community forums, or word-of-mouth. This leads to several pain points:

*   **Information Scarcity & Inaccuracy:** It's difficult to find a consolidated, up-to-date list of genuinely dog-friendly parks, their precise locations, and crucial details about amenities (e.g., water points, waste bag dispensers, shaded areas, enclosed off-leash zones).
*   **Uncertainty & Wasted Effort:** Owners frequently arrive at parks only to discover they are not truly dog-friendly, lack necessary facilities, or have strict restrictions, leading to frustration, wasted travel time, and disappointment.
*   **Safety Concerns:** Without clear information on park conditions, crowd levels, or specific rules, owners may unknowingly take their dogs to unsuitable or potentially unsafe environments.
*   **Limited Socialization Opportunities:** The difficulty in finding appropriate venues limits opportunities for dogs to socialize with other canines, which is crucial for their behavioral development and overall happiness.
*   **Lack of Community Connection:** There's no unified platform for dog owners to share experiences, organize playdates, or report real-time park conditions.
