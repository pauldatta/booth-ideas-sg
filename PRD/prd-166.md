# Celestial Alignment Simulator PRD

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the Product Requirements for the "Celestial Alignment Simulator" â€“ an innovative, interactive application designed to provide users with a dynamic platform to explore and manipulate simulated celestial orbits and alignments. The project aims to bridge the gap in existing planetarium software by offering direct, hands-on control over orbital mechanics, enhanced by AI algorithms, making complex astronomical concepts accessible and engaging for a wide audience.

## 2. Problem Statement

Many individuals, from students to space enthusiasts, struggle to intuitively grasp the intricate principles of orbital mechanics and celestial alignments. Traditional planetarium software, while often visually stunning, typically offers a passive viewing experience. Users can observe pre-programmed simulations but lack the ability to directly interact with, manipulate, and experiment with orbital parameters to understand cause-and-effect relationships.

**Pain Points:**
*   **Lack of Direct Interaction:** Existing tools often prohibit users from directly modifying planetary orbits or instantly aligning celestial bodies, limiting experiential learning.
*   **Conceptual Complexity:** Orbital mechanics and the conditions for planetary alignments are abstract concepts that are difficult to visualize and understand without dynamic, interactive models.
*   **Passive Learning:** Relying solely on static diagrams or pre-set animations leads to rote memorization rather than deep conceptual understanding.
*   **Limited Experimentation:** Users cannot easily test hypotheses about how changes in mass, velocity, or orbital paths affect the relative positions and conjunctions of celestial objects.

This product addresses these pain points by empowering users with an interactive sandbox where planets behave as customizable nodes, responding directly to user input, particularly for alignment, thereby transforming passive observation into active discovery.

## 7. Technical Considerations

Developing the Celestial Alignment Simulator will require a robust technical stack capable of handling 3D rendering, physics simulations, and responsive user interactions.

*   **Core Development Engine:**
    *   **Option 1: Unity 3D / Unreal Engine:** Recommended for their powerful 3D rendering capabilities, built-in physics engines, cross-platform deployment, and extensive asset stores. C# (Unity) or C++ (Unreal) would be the primary programming languages.
    *   **Option 2: Three.js / WebGL (for web-based):** A viable option for a browser-accessible application, leveraging JavaScript. This offers lower barrier-to-entry for users but might require more custom development for physics and performance optimization.

*   **Physics Simulation:**
    *   **Orbital Mechanics:** A simplified N-body simulation (e.g., calculating gravitational forces between the central star and each planet, and optionally between planets for advanced scenarios) will be implemented. Built-in physics engines (like Unity's PhysX) can be leveraged and adapted, or a custom, highly optimized system could be developed using languages like C++ or Python for numerical stability.
    *   **Performance Optimization:** Adaptive time-stepping, level-of-detail (LOD) for distant objects, and optimizing force calculations to manage performance with many nodes.

*   **AI for Alignment:**
    *   **Algorithm Type:** Pathfinding algorithms (e.g., A*, RRT) or optimization techniques (e.g., gradient descent, genetic algorithms) will be crucial for calculating the optimal or most plausible orbital adjustments to achieve a desired alignment from a given starting state.
    *   **Machine Learning Integration:** Potentially use ML models (e.g., reinforcement learning) to learn and suggest 'interesting' or stable alignment patterns, or to fine-tune orbital parameters for specific aesthetic results.

*   **User Interface (UI) / User Experience (UX):**
    *   **Framework:** Utilize the chosen engine's UI system (e.g., Unity UI, Unreal's UMG) for desktop, or a modern web framework (e.g., React, Vue) if a Three.js approach is chosen.
    *   **Input Handling:** Design for both mouse/keyboard and potential touch interfaces (for future mobile/tablet versions).

*   **Data Persistence:**
    *   **Scenario Saving:** JSON or SQLite database for efficiently saving and loading user-created celestial configurations and preferences.

*   **Deployment Targets:**
    *   Initial focus on desktop platforms (Windows, macOS). WebGL (browser-based) or mobile (iOS, Android) as potential future expansions.

## 8. Potential Risks & Mitigations

Developing an interactive celestial simulator presents several challenges that need to be addressed proactively.

*   **Risk 1: Performance Bottlenecks with Complex Simulations.**
    *   **Description:** As the number of celestial bodies or the complexity of orbital interactions increases, the simulation could experience significant slowdowns, impacting user experience.
    *   **Mitigation:** Implement rigorous performance profiling early in development. Optimize physics calculations (e.g., using simpler 2-body approximations for most interactions, adaptive time-stepping, culling distant objects). Establish clear limits on the number of interactive nodes and visual complexity.

*   **Risk 2: Complexity and Accuracy of AI-driven Alignment Algorithms.**
    *   **Description:** Developing AI that can reliably and smoothly adjust multiple orbits to achieve specific alignments while maintaining a sense of realism or aesthetic appeal can be highly challenging.
    *   **Mitigation:** Start with simpler, rule-based alignment logic (e.g., direct velocity/position adjustments) and progressively introduce more sophisticated AI (pathfinding, optimization) in iterations. Conduct extensive testing and user feedback loops to refine the algorithms. Clearly define what
