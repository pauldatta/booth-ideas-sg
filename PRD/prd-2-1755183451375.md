# Product Requirements Document: Ingredient-Based Recipe Generator

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a mobile application designed to address common household challenges related to meal planning and food waste. The "Ingredient-Based Recipe Generator" application aims to empower users to efficiently utilize the ingredients they already possess, thereby reducing food waste, saving money, and diversifying their culinary experiences. By leveraging advanced Artificial Intelligence, the application will provide instant, tailored recipe suggestions based on user-inputted available ingredients, transforming kitchen inventory into inspiring meal solutions.

## 2. Problem Statement

Many individuals and households frequently face the dilemma of having a collection of various ingredients but lacking the inspiration or knowledge to combine them into coherent, appealing meals. This often leads to several pain points:

*   **Food Waste**: Perishable ingredients purchased with good intentions often spoil before being used, contributing significantly to household food waste and financial loss.
*   **Decision Fatigue**: The mental burden of deciding "what to cook" daily, especially with limited or specific ingredients, can be overwhelming and time-consuming.
*   **Repetitive Meals**: Users often resort to cooking the same familiar dishes, even when new ingredients are available, due to a lack of creativity or knowledge about alternative uses.
*   **Financial Strain**: Frequent reliance on takeout or impulse grocery purchases to avoid cooking with existing ingredients can lead to increased expenditure.

Our product seeks to directly alleviate these struggles by providing an intelligent, accessible, and intuitive solution that turns ingredient scarcity into culinary opportunity.
