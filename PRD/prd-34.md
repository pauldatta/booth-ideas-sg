# Product Requirements Document: SnackTrack Mobile App

## 1. Introduction

SnackTrack is a mobile application designed to revolutionize how individuals manage their household snack inventory. This document outlines the vision, scope, and requirements for the SnackTrack app, aiming to provide users with a seamless and intelligent solution for tracking non-perishable snack items in their cabinets. By leveraging intuitive input methods and smart organizational features, SnackTrack will empower users to reduce food waste, maintain an always-current inventory, and ultimately save money by preventing duplicate purchases.

## 2. Problem Statement

In many households, managing snack inventory is a persistent organizational challenge. Individuals frequently purchase snacks, only to forget their existence, misplace them in cluttered cabinets, or discover them long after their expiration dates. This leads to several significant pain points:

*   **Financial Waste:** Users repeatedly purchase items they already own, resulting in unnecessary expenditure.
*   **Food Waste:** Expired or forgotten snacks contribute directly to household food waste, impacting both the environment and personal finances.
*   **Disorganization & Frustration:** Cluttered and unmanaged snack cabinets create stress and make it difficult for users to quickly find what they're looking for, leading to a disorganized kitchen environment.
*   **Lack of Visibility:** There's no single, easily accessible source of truth for what snacks are currently available, their quantities, or their expiry dates.

This lack of an efficient tracking system results in a common cycle of overbuying, waste, and frustration that SnackTrack aims to comprehensively address.

## 3. Target Audience

The primary users of the SnackTrack application are **homeowners and renters** who are motivated to efficiently manage their household snack inventory and minimize food waste. They typically exhibit the following characteristics and motivations:

*   **Organization-Oriented:** They value order and efficiency in their homes and are actively looking for tools to help them maintain it.
*   **Budget-Conscious:** They are mindful of their spending and seek ways to reduce unnecessary expenses, such as redundant grocery purchases.
*   **Waste-Averse:** They are concerned about food waste, both for environmental reasons and to maximize the value of their purchases.
*   **Tech-Adept (but busy):** While comfortable using mobile applications, they require solutions that are intuitive, quick, and seamlessly integrate into their busy daily routines, rather than adding another chore.
*   **Families and Individuals:** This includes busy parents struggling to keep track of various snack preferences for their children, as well as single individuals or couples who want to optimize their pantry management.
