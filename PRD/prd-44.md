# Product Requirements Document: Daily Sleep Tracker App

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a new mobile application designed to empower individuals to effortlessly track and gain insights into their daily sleep patterns. In an era where well-being is paramount, understanding and improving sleep is a critical component of overall health. This application aims to be the go-to simple, dedicated tool for users to accurately log their sleep duration, visualize historical data, and ultimately make informed decisions to enhance their rest and well-being.

## 2. Problem Statement

Despite widespread awareness of sleep's critical role in health, many individuals struggle with consistent, accurate, and insightful monitoring of their daily sleep. Current methods often involve manual, inconsistent journaling, or rely on complex wearables that may be inaccessible or overwhelming for casual users. The core pain points include:

*   **Lack of Simplicity:** Existing solutions are often feature-heavy, making simple daily logging cumbersome.
*   **Inaccurate Self-Reporting:** Without a dedicated tool, users often approximate sleep times, leading to unreliable data.
*   **Absence of Historical Context:** It's difficult for users to recall or visualize past sleep patterns, hindering the identification of long-term trends or inconsistencies.
*   **Difficulty Identifying Patterns:** Users lack a clear, visual representation of their sleep data over time, making it hard to spot correlations between sleep and daily activities, or recognize recurring issues.
*   **No Actionable Insights:** Most basic tracking methods provide raw data but fail to translate it into understandable trends or actionable advice.

These issues collectively prevent users from gaining accurate insights into their sleep habits, limiting their ability to make informed decisions for improving their rest and overall health.

## 3. Target Audience

The primary target user for the Daily Sleep Tracker App is any individual who is interested in understanding and improving their personal sleep habits. This encompasses a broad demographic but specifically includes:

*   **Students and Professionals:** Those with demanding schedules who need to manage their energy levels and optimize performance through better sleep.
*   **Casual Users:** People who are curious about their sleep patterns and want a simple, unobtrusive way to track them without complex features.
*   **Individuals New to Sleep Tracking:** Users who find existing sleep tracking apps or wearables too complex or expensive.

Their motivations include gaining clarity on their sleep, identifying areas for improvement, and ultimately enhancing their physical and mental performance. Their goals are to consistently track sleep, understand their unique patterns, and leverage this knowledge to improve their sleep hygiene and overall quality of life.
