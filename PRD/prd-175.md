# Product Requirements Document: Real-Time Bus Commuter Feedback Analysis System

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a new application designed for the Land Transport Authority (LTA) to revolutionize how bus commuter feedback is analyzed. The system's primary purpose is to provide LTA staff with a powerful, real-time tool that processes diverse feedback data, identifies key service improvement areas, and automatically generates actionable reports for specific bus routes. By leveraging advanced AI and machine learning capabilities, this application aims to transition LTA from reactive, manual feedback processing to a proactive, data-driven approach, ultimately enhancing bus service reliability and commuter satisfaction across Singapore.

## 2. Problem Statement

The Land Transport Authority (LTA) currently faces significant challenges in efficiently processing and acting upon bus commuter feedback. Existing methods are predominantly manual, fragmented, and time-consuming, leading to several critical pain points:

*   **Delayed Insights:** The manual aggregation and analysis of feedback from various sources (e.g., social media, call centers, LTA's public portals) introduce substantial delays. By the time trends are identified, the issues may have already escalated or become persistent problems, negatively impacting commuter experience.
*   **Resource Intensiveness:** Dedicated staff spend considerable time sifting through vast amounts of textual data, categorizing feedback, and manually compiling reports. This diverts valuable resources from strategic planning and implementation of improvements.
*   **Lack of Real-time Responsiveness:** Without a real-time analysis capability, LTA cannot swiftly identify emerging issues or sudden spikes in negative feedback for specific routes or timings. This hinders immediate intervention and resolution.
*   **Subjectivity & Inconsistency:** Manual analysis can be subjective, leading to inconsistencies in how feedback is interpreted and prioritized. This can result in less objective decision-making regarding service enhancements.
*   **Difficulty in Identifying Root Causes:** Current processes often struggle to pinpoint the underlying causes of recurring complaints beyond surface-level observations, making it challenging to implement truly effective and lasting solutions.
*   **Missed Opportunities for Proactive Improvement:** The reactive nature of current feedback processing means LTA often responds to problems rather than proactively identifying and mitigating potential issues before they significantly impact commuters.

This application seeks to directly address these pain points by providing an automated, intelligent, and real-time solution for feedback analysis, thereby enabling LTA to make faster, more informed decisions for service optimization.

## 3. Target Audience

The primary target users for this application are **Land Transport Authority (LTA) staff** across various departments responsible for public bus service planning, operations, and commuter experience management. Specifically, this includes:

*   **Service Planners/Analysts:** Individuals tasked with designing, optimizing, and evaluating bus routes and schedules. Their motivation is to ensure optimal resource allocation, reduce commuter wait times, and improve overall service efficiency. They need quick access to data to justify changes and measure impact.
*   **Operations Managers:** Staff overseeing the day-to-day running of bus services, including fleet management, driver performance, and incident response. Their goal is to maintain high operational standards, address immediate issues (e.g., delays, breakdowns), and ensure smooth service delivery. They require real-time alerts and actionable insights to deploy resources effectively.
*   **Commuter Relations/Customer Service Teams:** Teams responsible for engaging with the public, responding to feedback, and managing public perception. Their motivation is to demonstrate LTA's responsiveness, resolve commuter grievances, and improve satisfaction. They benefit from aggregated, categorized feedback to identify common concerns and craft targeted communications.
*   **Policy Makers/Leadership:** Senior staff who require high-level summaries and strategic insights to inform long-term policy decisions, budget allocation, and public transport strategy. They need reliable data to demonstrate accountability and progress in improving public transport.

**Motivations and Goals of Target Users:**

*   **Improve Service Quality:** A fundamental desire to enhance the reliability, comfort, and efficiency of bus services for all commuters.
*   **Enhance Commuter Satisfaction:** To ensure positive experiences for commuters, fostering trust and loyalty in public transport.
