# Product Requirements Document: EurekaNotes

## 1. Introduction

EurekaNotes is an innovative, AI-powered note-taking application designed to revolutionize the way individuals interact with their knowledge. In a digital landscape saturated with functional yet often uninspiring note-taking tools, EurekaNotes distinguishes itself by transforming the mundane act of recording information into an engaging, insightful, and creatively stimulating experience. Our primary objective is to combat user disengagement and incomplete knowledge capture by integrating a unique "surprise twist" â€“ an intelligent, AI-driven engine that provides contextual insights, creative prompts, and interdisciplinary connections based on the user's notes. This product aims to enhance knowledge retention, foster critical thinking, and unlock new levels of creative output for its users.

## 2. Problem Statement

The current digital note-taking market, while robust in basic functionality, suffers from a critical lack of engagement. Users frequently experience: 

*   **Passive Information Capture:** Notes often serve as mere repositories of information, with little to no active processing or synthesis occurring post-capture. This leads to information overload and makes it difficult to extract actionable insights or consolidate knowledge.
*   **Disjointed Thought Processes:** Users struggle to connect disparate ideas, notes, or concepts across different projects or learning domains, inhibiting holistic understanding and preventing the emergence of novel connections.
*   **Lack of Inspiration and Creative Blocks:** When reviewing notes for ideation or problem-solving, users often face mental blocks or struggle to see beyond the explicit content of their notes, limiting creative breakthroughs.
*   **Ineffective Knowledge Retention:** Without active engagement and prompting for deeper thought, information captured in notes is often quickly forgotten or poorly integrated into long-term memory.
*   **Monotony and Disinterest:** The act of note-taking itself can feel uninspiring, leading to incomplete notes, abandoned projects, or a general disinterest in leveraging notes effectively.

Existing applications fail to proactively facilitate deeper learning, creative expansion, or critical analysis of captured information, leaving a significant gap in the market for a tool that truly partners with the user's cognitive process.

## 3. Target Audience

EurekaNotes is designed for a diverse demographic of knowledge workers and learners who seek more than just a digital notepad. Our primary target users include:
