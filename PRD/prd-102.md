# Sandwich Savant: AI-Powered Sandwich Recipe App PRD

## 1. Introduction

The Sandwich Savant project aims to revolutionize the way individuals approach homemade sandwiches. In an era where mealtime monotony is a common struggle, particularly with simple options like sandwiches, this mobile application will serve as a dynamic source of culinary inspiration. By leveraging artificial intelligence, Sandwich Savant will provide users with a diverse, personalized, and searchable database of sandwich recipes and creative ideas, ultimately reducing meal prep stress and fostering greater creativity in the kitchen.

## 2. Problem Statement

Many individuals frequently experience a lack of inspiration and variety when it comes to preparing sandwiches at home. This often leads to repetitive meal choices, culinary boredom, and a perception that sandwiches are unexciting or limited. Key pain points include:

*   **Mealtime Monotony**: Users often cycle through the same 2-3 sandwich types, leading to a lack of enjoyment and a feeling of uninspired eating.
*   **Ingredient Overload/Waste**: Leftover ingredients might sit in the fridge because users can't think of new ways to combine them into a meal, especially a quick one like a sandwich.
*   **Time Constraint Stress**: Busy individuals need quick meal ideas but spend too much time trying to brainstorm new combinations, often defaulting to old, unexciting options.
*   **Lack of Culinary Confidence**: Some users may feel they lack the creativity or knowledge to experiment with new flavor profiles or ingredient combinations for sandwiches.
*   **Information Overload**: While many recipes exist online, finding specific, tailored sandwich ideas that match available ingredients or dietary preferences can be time-consuming and overwhelming.
