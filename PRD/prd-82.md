# Product Requirements Document: Mall Navigator App

## 1. Introduction

The Mall Navigator App is a mobile application designed to significantly enhance the shopping experience for visitors to large shopping malls. Its primary purpose is to provide an intuitive, centralized, and efficient tool for users to discover, locate, and navigate the diverse range of shops available within a specified mall. By addressing the common challenges of finding specific stores and exploring new retail options, this project aims to reduce user frustration, save time, and ultimately create a more enjoyable and productive shopping journey.

*   **Lack of Centralized Information:** Shoppers often rely on outdated physical directories, static mall websites, or general search engines that lack real-time accuracy and detailed in-mall context.
