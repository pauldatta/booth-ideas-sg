# Product Requirements Document: Matchstick Counter App

## 1. Introduction
This document outlines the requirements for the 'Matchstick Counter' mobile application, a tool designed to revolutionize the way small, identical items, specifically matchsticks, are counted. Leveraging advanced computer vision and artificial intelligence, the app aims to provide users with a fast, highly accurate, and reliable digital solution for counting matchsticks from either uploaded images or a live camera feed. This project's core purpose is to eliminate the tedium and human error associated with manual counting, thereby saving users significant time and improving precision in various applications, from inventory management to game setup.

## 2. Problem Statement
The manual counting of numerous small, identical objects, such as matchsticks, presents significant challenges. Current methods are inherently **time-consuming**, requiring meticulous attention and repetitive actions that lead to user fatigue. More critically, they are **prone to human error**, especially when dealing with large quantities, resulting in inaccurate counts that can have adverse effects on inventory management, project planning, or game integrity. This lack of efficiency and accuracy translates into wasted time, potential financial losses due to miscounts, and frustration for individuals and businesses alike. Existing generic object counting solutions often lack the specific optimization needed for uniform, thin objects like matchsticks, or are too complex and costly for everyday use. There is a clear need for an accessible, specialized, and highly accurate tool to address these pain points.

## 3. Target Audience
The primary users of the Matchstick Counter app can be categorized into several groups, all sharing a common need for accurate and efficient counting:

*   **Individuals & Hobbyists:** Users who frequently play games involving matchsticks (e.g., puzzles, counting games) or use them for craft projects. Their motivation is to quickly and accurately set up games or manage materials without tedious manual effort. They value ease of use and speed.
*   **Small Businesses & Retailers:** Shops that sell matchsticks in bulk or as part of larger kits, or businesses that use them for specific industrial processes (e.g., pyrotechnics, art supplies). Their motivation is accurate inventory management, reducing stocktake time, and minimizing discrepancies. They require high accuracy and potentially data export features.
*   **Educators & Researchers:** Individuals who might use matchsticks for demonstrations, experiments, or teaching counting concepts. Their goal is reliability and a clear visual representation of quantities for educational purposes.

All target users seek a solution that is **convenient, reliable, and significantly more accurate than manual counting**. They are often frustrated by the current methods' slowness and the inevitability of errors.

## 7. Technical Considerations

*   **AI/Computer Vision Framework:** Given the need for novel AI vision models, we will explore advanced object detection and instance segmentation techniques. Options include: 
    *   **Custom Model Training:** Leveraging frameworks like **PyTorch** or **TensorFlow** to train custom models (e.g., Mask R-CNN, YOLOv8 with segmentation) specifically on diverse datasets of matchsticks. This allows for superior accuracy and robustness under varying conditions.
    *   **On-Device Inference:** For optimal speed and offline capabilities, convert trained models to mobile-optimized formats like **TensorFlow Lite (Android)** or **Core ML (iOS)**. This minimizes latency and reduces reliance on cloud connectivity.
    *   **Cloud-Based Inference (Fallback/Advanced):** For scenarios requiring extremely high precision or complex model updates, a hybrid approach could involve cloud-based inference using **AWS SageMaker, Google Cloud AI Platform, or Azure Machine Learning**. However, the primary focus will be on efficient on-device processing.
*   **Mobile Development Platform:**
    *   **Native Development (Swift for iOS, Kotlin for Android):** Offers the best performance, access to device-specific features (camera API optimization), and native UI/UX. Recommended for a high-performance, responsive application.
    *   **Cross-Platform (Flutter/React Native):** Could be considered for faster initial development and wider reach, but might require more effort to optimize computer vision pipelines and native camera interactions.
*   **Backend & Cloud Infrastructure:**
    *   **Database:** For storing user history and potentially aggregated, anonymized feedback data (e.g., Firebase Firestore, AWS DynamoDB, PostgreSQL).
    *   **Storage:** For raw user-submitted images (for feedback/model retraining) (e.g., AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage).
    *   **Analytics:** For tracking user engagement and performance metrics (e.g., Google Analytics for Firebase, Mixpanel).
    *   **Model Updates:** A robust CI/CD pipeline for continuously improving and deploying new AI model versions.

## 8. Potential Risks & Mitigations

*   **Risk: AI Model Accuracy & Robustness:** The primary technical challenge is achieving high accuracy under diverse real-world conditions (lighting, shadows, matchstick orientation, partial occlusion, different matchstick types).
    *   **Mitigation:** Invest heavily in collecting a large, diverse, and well-annotated dataset. Continuously train and refine advanced vision models. Implement a user feedback loop for incorrect counts to identify and address edge cases. Robust testing in varied environments.
*   **Risk: On-Device Performance & Battery Drain:** Complex AI models can be resource-intensive, leading to slow processing or excessive battery consumption on older devices.
    *   **Mitigation:** Optimize models for mobile deployment (e.g., quantization, pruning, using TensorFlow Lite/Core ML). Implement efficient camera frame processing. Provide performance settings for users. Thorough testing on a range of devices.
*   **Risk: User Adoption & Market Competition:** Users might be hesitant to adopt a new tool, or competing (even if less accurate) solutions might emerge.
    *   **Mitigation:** Focus on superior accuracy and ease of use as key differentiators. Implement strong marketing and app store optimization. Offer a compelling free tier with a clear value proposition for premium features. Gather early user feedback for continuous improvement.
*   **Risk: Monetization Challenges:** Convincing users to pay for premium features.
    *   **Mitigation:** Clearly define the value proposition of premium features (e.g., unlimited history, export). Conduct A/B testing on pricing models and feature bundles. Offer a free trial period for premium features.
*   **Risk: Privacy & Data Security:** Handling user-submitted images (even if for model training) raises privacy concerns.
    *   **Mitigation:** Implement strong data encryption and security protocols. Ensure clear, transparent privacy policies. Obtain explicit user consent for data usage (e.g., image submission for model improvement). Anonymize data where possible.
