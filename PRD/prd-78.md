# Product Requirements Document: Home Hardware Tool Inventory App

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a mobile application designed to help homeowners and DIY enthusiasts effectively catalog, track, and manage their personal hardware tool collections. The primary goal is to reduce frustration, save time, and prevent unnecessary duplicate purchases by providing an easy-to-use digital inventory system. This application aims to transform how users interact with their tools, moving from chaotic clutter to organized efficiency.

## 2. Problem Statement

Many homeowners and DIY enthusiasts face a common yet significant challenge: managing their diverse collection of hardware tools. The current state often leads to:

*   **Lost or Misplaced Tools**: Tools frequently go missing within cluttered workshops, garages, or storage areas, leading to prolonged search times right when they're needed most.
*   **Duplicate Purchases**: Unable to locate an existing tool, users often resort to buying a new one, resulting in wasted money and further accumulation of unused items.
*   **Lack of Overview**: Users lack a clear understanding of what tools they own, how many of each, or where they are stored, making planning projects or lending tools difficult.
*   **Inefficient Use of Time**: Valuable time is lost searching for tools, detracting from productive DIY tasks or leisure activities.
*   **Maintenance Neglect**: Without a system, routine maintenance or replacement of tools is often overlooked, leading to premature wear and failure.

These pain points highlight a significant need for a structured and accessible solution that simplifies tool management.

## 3. Target Audience

The primary target audience for this application is:

*   **Homeowners (30-65 years old)**: Individuals who own their homes and regularly undertake maintenance, repairs, or improvement projects. They likely have a moderate to large collection of various tools.
    *   **Motivations**: Desire for efficiency, saving money (by not re-purchasing), reducing frustration, maintaining an organized home, and being self-reliant for home tasks.
    *   **Goals**: Quickly find specific tools, know what tools they own, prevent clutter, and efficiently manage home projects.
*   **DIY Enthusiasts/Hobbyists (25-60 years old)**: Individuals passionate about building, crafting, or repairing things around the house or for hobbies. They often acquire specialized tools and have a keen interest in organization.
    *   **Motivations**: Optimizing their workspace, taking pride in their tool collection, maximizing project time, and exploring new tools or techniques.
    *   **Goals**: Maintain an organized and accessible workshop, easily track specialized tools, and potentially share their collection with others or track tool lending.

Both segments value convenience, organization, and efficiency, and are comfortable with mobile technology.
