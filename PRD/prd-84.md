# Product Requirements Document: Smart Locker Assignment System

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for the Smart Locker Assignment System, a digital application designed to streamline and automate the process of managing locker assignments within various organizations. The primary goal is to provide an efficient, centralized, and intelligent solution that replaces cumbersome manual tracking methods, reduces administrative overhead, prevents allocation errors, and enhances the overall user experience for both administrators and end-users.

## 2. Problem Statement

Organizations such as schools, universities, offices, gyms, and event venues frequently face significant challenges in managing the allocation of physical lockers to their users. The current manual or rudimentary spreadsheet-based systems lead to a multitude of pain points:

*   **Time-Consuming Administration:** Administrators spend excessive amounts of time manually tracking assignments, verifying availability, and resolving conflicts, diverting resources from more critical tasks.
*   **High Error Rate:** Manual data entry and tracking are prone to human error, leading to incorrect assignments, double-bookings, and lost records, which can cause frustration and operational delays.
*   **Lack of Centralized Overview:** Without a single, real-time source of truth, it's difficult for administrators to quickly ascertain locker availability, occupancy rates, or who is assigned to which locker, particularly across multiple locations or large facilities.
*   **Inefficient Resource Utilization:** Suboptimal allocation strategies can lead to underutilized lockers in some areas while others are oversubscribed, resulting in inefficient use of valuable physical space.
*   **Difficulty in Auditing and Reporting:** Generating reports on locker usage, historical assignments, or occupancy trends is a laborious process, if possible at all, making it hard to make data-driven decisions.
*   **Poor User Experience:** Users often face delays in getting a locker assigned, or struggle to know which locker is theirs, or if a locker is available, leading to dissatisfaction.

These issues collectively contribute to operational inefficiencies, increased costs, and a suboptimal experience for both administrators and the individuals needing locker access.

## 3. Target Audience

The primary users of the Smart Locker Assignment System are individuals and departments responsible for the allocation, management, and monitoring of physical storage spaces within an organization. These include:

*   **Facility Managers:** Responsible for the upkeep and operational efficiency of buildings. Their motivation is to optimize space utilization, reduce operational costs associated with locker management, and ensure a smooth experience for all occupants. They need a system that provides a comprehensive overview of all assets (lockers) and their status.
*   **School/University Administrators:** Tasked with managing resources for students and staff. Their goal is to efficiently assign lockers to a large and frequently changing student body, minimize conflicts, ensure equitable access, and handle reassignments at the end of academic terms. They value simplicity, speed, and the ability to easily track assignments.
*   **Office Managers/HR Departments:** In charge of employee facilities and well-being. They aim to provide employees with convenient storage options, manage locker assignments for hot-desking environments, onboarding/offboarding, and ensure compliance with office policies. They seek a system that integrates well with employee databases and provides clear accountability.
