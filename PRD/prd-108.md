# Product Requirements Document: Meeting Recorder & AI Assistant

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a new application designed to assist professionals in managing their meeting information. The core purpose of this project is to develop a secure, intuitive mobile and web application that records meeting audio and leverages advanced Artificial Intelligence to process, summarize, and extract actionable insights from these recordings. The ultimate goal is to enhance user productivity, improve meeting recall, and ensure no critical information or action item is overlooked, thereby addressing a significant pain point for busy professionals.

## 2. Problem Statement

In today's fast-paced professional environment, individuals often attend numerous meetings daily. These meetings, while crucial for collaboration and decision-making, present several challenges:

*   **Information Overload:** Professionals are bombarded with information, making it difficult to actively participate, take comprehensive notes, and retain all important details simultaneously.
*   **Forgotten Action Items:** Verbal commitments and assigned tasks are frequently forgotten or misremembered after a meeting, leading to missed deadlines, re-work, and decreased accountability.
*   **Difficulty Recalling Details:** When revisiting past discussions, finding specific points or recalling the context of a decision can be a time-consuming and frustrating exercise.
*   **Inefficient Note-Taking:** Manual note-taking can be distracting, often leading to partial or incomplete records, and it diverts attention from the actual discussion.
*   **Lack of Centralized Records:** Meeting notes are often scattered across different tools, personal notebooks, or email threads, making it challenging to maintain a coherent history of discussions.

These pain points collectively contribute to inefficiencies, reduced productivity, and potential for critical information to be lost, directly impacting project timelines, team collaboration, and overall business outcomes.
