# Product Requirements Document: Food Surplus Redistribution Platform

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a novel application designed to significantly reduce food waste from grocery chains and combat food insecurity. The application, tentatively named "SurplusConnect," will serve as a centralized, intelligent platform enabling grocery stores to efficiently track their edible surplus food and automatically connect with a network of local charities for timely pickup and distribution. By leveraging AI and streamlining logistics, SurplusConnect aims to transform how grocery waste is managed, ensuring that nutritious, edible food reaches those in need rather than landfills.

## 2. Problem Statement

Grocery chains worldwide face a pervasive and costly problem: the substantial amount of edible food that goes to waste. Millions of tons of perfectly good food, including fresh produce, baked goods, and packaged items nearing their best-by dates, are discarded annually. This waste represents a triple threat:

*   **Economic Loss**: Grocery stores incur significant costs associated with disposing of food waste, including labor, hauling fees, and lost revenue from unsold products.
*   **Environmental Impact**: Decomposing food in landfills generates methane, a potent greenhouse gas, contributing to climate change. The resources (water, energy, labor) used to produce, process, and transport this food are also wasted.
*   **Social Inequity**: Paradoxically, while vast quantities of food are wasted, millions of people experience food insecurity. Efficiently redirecting surplus food can provide vital nutrition to vulnerable populations.

Existing solutions for food donation are often manual, fragmented, and inefficient. Grocery staff spend valuable time identifying, sorting, and coordinating pickups, leading to low participation rates and missed opportunities. Charities struggle with unpredictable donation volumes, logistical challenges, and the lack of a centralized system to identify available food near them. The lack of an integrated, automated system exacerbates these pain points, making it difficult for all parties to effectively contribute to food waste reduction and hunger relief.

## 3. Target Audience

The primary users of the SurplusConnect application are:

*   **Grocery Store Managers and Staff**: These individuals are responsible for inventory management, waste disposal protocols, and often have a desire to contribute positively to their local communities. Their motivations include reducing operational costs (disposal fees), improving store efficiency, enhancing the store's public image, and fulfilling corporate social responsibility mandates. Their pain points revolve around the manual effort involved in tracking surplus, the lack of an easy donation process, and the time-consuming coordination with charities. They need a system that is intuitive, quick to use, and integrates seamlessly into their daily routines.

*   **Charity Coordinators and Drivers**: Representatives from food banks, shelters, and other non-profit organizations that distribute food to those in need. Their motivations include securing consistent, nutritious food supplies for their beneficiaries, optimizing their pickup routes, and reducing operational costs. Their pain points include the unpredictability of donations, the manual effort of coordinating with multiple stores, and inefficient logistics. They need a system that provides real-time visibility into available food, simplifies scheduling, and helps them manage their distribution effectively.

## 7. Technical Considerations

**Proposed Tech Stack:**

*   **Backend**: A robust, scalable cloud-native architecture. We recommend using **Python (with Django/Flask) or Node.js (with Express)** for API development due to their extensive libraries, community support, and suitability for AI/ML integration. Hosted on a cloud provider like **AWS (Amazon Web Services)** or **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)** for scalability, reliability, and global reach.
*   **Database**: **PostgreSQL** for relational data (user profiles, store/charity details, transaction logs) due to its reliability and strong support for complex queries. For highly flexible, potentially high-volume item logging and AI feature data, **MongoDB** could be considered for specific non-relational data segments.
*   **Frontend (Web)**: **React.js** or **Vue.js** for a responsive and intuitive web application, offering a modern user interface and efficient data rendering.
*   **Frontend (Mobile)**: **React Native** or **Flutter** for cross-platform mobile development (iOS and Android), providing native-like performance and a consistent user experience for grocery staff and charity drivers.
*   **AI/ML**: Utilize **Python's data science ecosystem** (e.g., scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch) for predictive analytics (waste prediction) and optimization algorithms (charity matching, route optimization). AWS SageMaker or GCP AI Platform could be used for model deployment and management.
*   **Mapping & Location Services**: **Google Maps API** or **OpenStreetMap (with Mapbox)** for geocoding, proximity search, route calculation, and real-time tracking.
*   **Messaging**: **AWS SNS/SQS** or **Google Cloud Pub/Sub** for reliable and scalable notification delivery (push notifications, SMS, email).
*   **Security**: Implement **OAuth 2.0** for secure authentication and authorization. Ensure data encryption at rest and in transit (SSL/TLS). Adhere to best practices for data privacy (e.g., GDPR principles for personal data).
*   **Architecture**: A **microservices architecture** will provide modularity, allowing independent development, deployment, and scaling of different components (e.g., User Service, Inventory Service, Matching Service, Notification Service).

## 8. Potential Risks & Mitigations

*   **Risk: Data Inaccuracy/Incompleteness from Grocery Staff.**
    *   **Mitigation**: Implement user-friendly interfaces with barcode scanning, auto-fill options, mandatory fields, and clear validation rules. Provide comprehensive training and clear documentation for grocery staff. Gamification or incentives could also encourage accurate logging.

*   **Risk: Low Charity Engagement or Capacity Issues.**
    *   **Mitigation**: Conduct extensive outreach and partnerships with established food banks and charity networks. Offer support (e.g., resources for acquiring refrigerated transport for smaller charities). Implement a rating/feedback system for charities to ensure reliability. Actively recruit new charities as more grocery stores join.

*   **Risk: Food Safety & Liability Concerns.**
    *   **Mitigation**: Clearly define and enforce food handling and donation guidelines based on local health regulations. Emphasize compliance with
