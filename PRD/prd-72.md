# Product Requirements Document: Dollar Bill Tracking App

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a novel mobile application designed to help individuals meticulously track their physical dollar bills. In an increasingly digital world, physical cash still plays a significant role in daily transactions, yet its usage often remains opaque, leading to a lack of financial oversight. This product aims to bridge that gap, empowering users with a comprehensive understanding of their cash spending habits, fostering improved personal financial management, and offering a unique, engaging interaction with physical currency.

## 2. Problem Statement

Despite the proliferation of digital payment methods, many individuals continue to rely on physical cash for various transactions. A significant pain point arises from the inherent difficulty in tracking these cash expenditures and incomes. Unlike digital transactions, cash movements leave no automatic digital trail, leading to several critical issues:

*   **Budget Inaccuracies:** Users frequently lose track of how their physical cash is spent, making it challenging to adhere to a budget accurately. This leads to discrepancies between planned and actual expenditures, undermining financial discipline.
*   **Lack of Financial Visibility:** Without a clear record of cash flow, users lack a holistic view of their overall financial health. This blind spot hinders effective financial planning, savings goals, and debt management.
*   **Difficulty in Financial Planning:** The inability to categorize or recall cash transactions makes it nearly impossible to analyze spending patterns, identify areas for reduction, or project future cash needs effectively.
*   **Forgotten Transactions:** Small, frequent cash purchases often go unrecorded and forgotten, cumulatively impacting one's financial standing more than anticipated.
*   **Engagement Gap:** Existing budgeting tools often focus solely on digital transactions, leaving the cash component of personal finance underserved and unengaging.

## 3. Target Audience

The primary target audience for this application is anyone who frequently uses physical dollar bills and wishes to gain better visibility into their cash flow. This includes, but is not limited to:

*   **Daily Cash Users:** Individuals who regularly make small purchases (coffee, snacks, public transport) with cash and find it hard to track these micro-transactions.
*   **Budget-Conscious Individuals:** People actively trying to manage their finances, create accurate budgets, and identify all spending categories, including cash.
*   **Financial Enthusiasts/Curious Individuals:** Users interested in a deeper, more granular understanding of their money, potentially even curious about the journey of specific dollar bills.
*   **Small Business Owners/Freelancers:** Individuals who deal with cash transactions for their business and need a simple way to log income and expenses for record-keeping purposes.
*   **Travelers:** Those who frequently use local currency in different countries and need a reliable way to track expenditures without relying solely on credit card statements.

**Motivations & Goals:**
