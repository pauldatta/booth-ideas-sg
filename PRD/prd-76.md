# Product Requirements Document: Sticky Note To-Do List Application

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a novel digital task management application, tentatively named "Sticky Notes To-Do". The primary purpose of this project is to revolutionize how individuals manage their daily tasks and reminders by combining the intuitive, visual nature of physical sticky notes with the power and efficiency of a digital platform. The application aims to provide a highly engaging, customizable, and effective tool that ensures users can easily organize, prioritize, and track their commitments, thereby enhancing personal productivity and reducing the likelihood of overlooked tasks.

## 2. Problem Statement

In an increasingly busy world, individuals across various demographics—from students to seasoned professionals—grapple with task management inefficiencies. Current solutions often fall short in several key areas:

*   **Fragmented Task Management:** Users frequently resort to a mix of physical notes, digital spreadsheets, email flags, and generic list apps, leading to scattered information and a lack of a single, coherent source of truth for their tasks.
*   **Lack of Visual Organization:** Traditional digital to-do lists, while functional, often lack the visual immediacy and flexibility of physical sticky notes. Users struggle to quickly grasp priorities, relationships between tasks, or the overall landscape of their workload at a glance.
*   **Difficulty in Prioritization:** Without a clear visual hierarchy or customizable categorization, important tasks can get lost amidst less critical ones, leading to missed deadlines or misallocated effort.
*   **Forgetting or Overlooking Tasks:** The absence of persistent, visually prominent reminders means that tasks, especially those added hastily, are often forgotten until it's too late.
*   **Inefficient Capture:** Translating ideas or tasks from physical notes (e.g., meeting scribbles, brainstorms) into an organized digital format is a manual, time-consuming process.

These pain points collectively contribute to decreased productivity, increased stress, and the frustrating experience of important items slipping through the cracks.

## 3. Target Audience
