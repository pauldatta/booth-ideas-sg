# Product Requirements Document: Singapore Inbound Shipment Tracker

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a new application designed to provide comprehensive, real-time tracking and predictive analytics for all inbound shipments destined for Singapore. Leveraging Singapore's strategic position as a global trade and logistics hub, this product aims to address the current challenges of fragmented information and lack of transparency in the shipment journey. The primary goal is to enhance transparency, reduce delays, improve operational efficiency, and provide peace of mind for businesses and individuals managing or expecting packages into Singapore.

## 2. Problem Statement

Singapore's robust global trade ecosystem leads to an immense volume of inbound shipments daily. However, current shipment tracking processes are often inefficient, characterized by a lack of real-time updates and fragmented information across multiple carrier platforms and logistics providers. This leads to several pain points:

*   **Lack of Transparency:** Users struggle to get a unified view of their shipment's status, often having to juggle multiple tracking numbers and websites for different legs of a journey or different carriers.
*   **Delayed Information:** Updates are frequently not real-time, causing uncertainty and making it difficult to plan for arrival, customs clearance, or onward distribution.
*   **Operational Inefficiencies:** Businesses face challenges in managing inventory, scheduling labor, and optimizing their supply chain due to unpredictable arrival times, leading to increased operational costs and potential penalties.
*   **Increased Anxiety:** Both businesses and individual consumers experience stress and uncertainty regarding the whereabouts and expected arrival of their critical or personal shipments.
*   **Limited Proactivity:** Without predictive insights, users are reactive to issues rather than proactive, often learning about delays only after they have occurred, making mitigation difficult.

This application seeks to solve these problems by consolidating data, providing real-time intelligence, and offering predictive capabilities to transform the inbound shipment experience for Singapore.
