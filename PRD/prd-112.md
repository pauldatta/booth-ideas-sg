# Daily Step Tracker Mobile Application PRD

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the Product Requirements Document (PRD) for a new mobile application designed to help individuals track their daily step count. The project aims to provide a simple, reliable, and engaging platform that empowers users to monitor their physical activity, set personal fitness goals, and ultimately foster a healthier lifestyle. By offering an intuitive user experience and accurate step tracking, this application seeks to become an essential tool for anyone looking to increase their physical activity and maintain health awareness.

## 2. Problem Statement

Many individuals struggle with consistently tracking their daily physical activity, specifically their step count. While the importance of regular movement for health and well-being is widely recognized, the current methods often present friction points:

*   **Lack of Simplicity**: Existing solutions can be overly complex, requiring manual input, dedicated wearable devices, or navigating through convoluted interfaces.
*   **Inconsistency and Inaccuracy**: Generic health apps or basic phone features may offer inconsistent or inaccurate step counts, leading to user distrust and demotivation.
*   **Difficulty in Monitoring Progress**: Without a clear and consistent method to track steps, users find it challenging to monitor their activity levels over time, understand their habits, or celebrate achievements.
*   **Lack of Motivation**: Without easily accessible data and insights, users often lack the motivation to push for higher activity levels or maintain their fitness goals.

These pain points collectively hinder individuals from effectively managing their physical activity, making it difficult to set and achieve health-related objectives.

*   **Busy Professionals**: People with demanding schedules who find it challenging to allocate specific time for workouts but want to ensure they are getting enough incidental activity throughout their day. They value simplicity and efficiency.
*   **Individuals with General Health Goals**: Users who might be aiming for weight management, improved cardiovascular health, or simply increased overall well-being. Their motivation stems from long-term health benefits.

**Motivations & Goals of the Target Audience:**
*   To easily and accurately track their daily steps without significant effort.
*   To understand their activity patterns and identify opportunities to increase movement.
