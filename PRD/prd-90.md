# Locker Tracker App: Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## 1. Introduction

The Locker Tracker app is a mobile application designed to alleviate the common frustration of forgetting or misplacing items stored in personal lockers. This project aims to provide users with a seamless and intuitive way to digitally log, categorize, and track the contents of their lockers, ensuring they always know what they have and where it is. By leveraging modern mobile technology and intelligent features, the Locker Tracker will transform locker management from a source of inconvenience into an organized, stress-free experience.

## 2. Problem Statement

Individuals who regularly use personal lockers at various facilities (gyms, schools, workplaces, public areas) frequently encounter the following pain points:

*   **Forgetfulness:** Users often forget exactly what items they have stored in their locker, leading to uncertainty when preparing for an activity or searching for a specific item.
*   **Misplacement:** Even when they remember having an item, its exact location within the locker can be forgotten, resulting in wasted time rummaging through contents.
*   **Inefficiency:** The act of physically checking a locker's contents can be time-consuming, especially when a user is not physically present at the locker's location.
*   **Duplication/Loss:** Unawareness of locker contents can lead to purchasing duplicate items or the perception that an item is lost when it is merely stored away.
