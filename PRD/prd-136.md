# Product Requirements Document: Dynamic Question Randomizer

## 1. Introduction
This document outlines the requirements for the Dynamic Question Randomizer, an application designed to enhance spontaneity and fairness in interactive question-based scenarios. The primary goal is to provide a robust and user-friendly tool that allows hosts, content creators, and educators to effortlessly select and display random questions from a predefined or custom list, thereby increasing audience engagement and simplifying content delivery.

## 2. Problem Statement
Many interactive activities, such as street interviews, live stream Q&A sessions, educational quizzes, or game shows, heavily rely on dynamic and unpredictable question selection to maintain audience interest and ensure fairness. Currently, individuals conducting these activities face several challenges:

*   **Lack of Spontaneity:** Manually picking questions from notes or physical cards can appear rehearsed, reducing the authentic, spontaneous feel crucial for engaging content.
*   **Bias and Repetition:** Without a true random selection mechanism, hosts might unconsciously favor certain questions or repeat them, leading to predictable patterns and disengagement.
*   **Logistical Burden:** Managing large lists of questions, especially in fast-paced environments, can be cumbersome and distracting, pulling the host's focus away from the interaction itself.
*   **Preparation Time:** Developing new, diverse sets of questions and organizing them for quick access is time-consuming.
*   **Limited Engagement:** Static or predictable question selection methods often fail to create the 'surprise' element that drives audience curiosity and participation.

This product aims to address these pain points by providing a seamless, digital solution for random question generation.

## 3. Target Audience
The primary users of the Dynamic Question Randomizer are individuals and organizations who facilitate interactive sessions requiring random question selection. These include:

*   **Street Interviewers:** Motivated to create viral, engaging content quickly and efficiently. They need a tool that is mobile-friendly, allows rapid question cycling, and reduces the visible effort of question management, enabling them to focus on the interviewee's response.
*   **Content Creators (Podcasters, YouTubers, Live Streamers):** Seeking to add dynamic, unpredictable segments to their shows. Their motivation is to keep audiences engaged, generate fresh content ideas, and simplify their content preparation workflow. They require a tool that integrates smoothly into their production setup and provides a 'surprise' element.
*   **Educators and Trainers:** Looking for innovative ways to make learning interactive, facilitate discussions, and fairly assess knowledge. They need a tool to promote active participation, ensure all students have an equal chance to answer, and break the ice in a fun manner.
*   **Event Hosts & Game Masters:** Hosting quizzes, panel discussions, or interactive games. Their goal is to maintain high energy, ensure fairness in question distribution, and reduce the mental load of managing game flow.

These users are united by a need for a reliable, easy-to-use solution that enhances the interactivity and fairness of their question-based engagements.
