# Product Requirements Document: RunTracker Mobile Application

## 1. Introduction
This document outlines the requirements for RunTracker, a new mobile application designed to empower individuals to accurately track their running performance, set personal fitness goals, and monitor their progress over time. The primary objective is to provide an intuitive, reliable, and engaging platform that addresses the common challenges runners face in manually tracking their workouts, ultimately enhancing their fitness journey.

## 2. Problem Statement
Many individuals engage in running as a core component of their fitness regimen, training for events, or simply maintaining a healthy lifestyle. However, accurately tracking running distance, pace, and route manually is often cumbersome, inaccurate, and lacks the necessary data for meaningful progress analysis. Existing solutions may be too complex, lack essential features, or suffer from poor GPS accuracy and user experience. Runners often struggle with:
*   **Inaccurate data**: Manual input or basic trackers may not precisely measure distance or pace.
*   **Lack of progress visualization**: It's difficult to see long-term trends, compare performance, or understand improvement without consolidated data.
*   **Difficulty in goal setting**: Without clear tracking, setting and monitoring specific, achievable goals becomes challenging.
*   **Limited insights**: Beyond raw data, runners often lack personalized feedback or adaptive guidance to optimize their training.
*   **Disconnected experience**: Data may be spread across various tools, making a holistic view of fitness elusive.

## 3. Target Audience
The primary users of RunTracker are individuals who run regularly for fitness, training, or competitive purposes. This includes, but is not limited to:
*   **Casual Fitness Runners**: Individuals who run a few times a week to maintain health, manage weight, or relieve stress. They seek simplicity, accuracy, and an easy way to see their progress.
*   **Amateur Race Participants**: Users training for 5Ks, 10Ks, half-marathons, or marathons. They require detailed pace analysis, route mapping, and the ability to track long-term performance against specific race goals.
*   **Dedicated Enthusiasts**: Runners who are passionate about the sport, constantly seeking to improve their speed, endurance, or distance. They value advanced analytics, personalized insights, and robust performance tracking features.
*   **Beginner Runners**: New to running and looking for a user-friendly tool to get started, track initial progress, and stay motivated.

Their motivations include improving physical health, achieving personal bests, training for specific events, managing stress, and enjoying the outdoors. They desire an application that is accurate, easy-to-use, provides meaningful data, and helps them stay motivated and achieve their running goals.
