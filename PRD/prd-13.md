# Product Requirements Document: Ingredient-Based Recipe Suggester

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a mobile application designed to revolutionize home cooking. The primary objective is to develop an intelligent system that suggests recipes based on the ingredients users currently possess, thereby reducing food waste, encouraging culinary exploration, and simplifying meal planning. This application aims to empower home cooks to make the most of their existing pantry and refrigerator contents, transforming the common challenge of 'what to cook' into an opportunity for creativity and efficiency.

## 2. Problem Statement

Many home cooks frequently face the dilemma of underutilized ingredients, leading to significant food waste and a lack of variety in their daily meals. The process of discovering new recipes that specifically align with available ingredients is often cumbersome, involving manual searches, tedious filtering, and frequent last-minute grocery runs for missing items. This not only results in financial waste but also stifles culinary creativity and adds unnecessary stress to meal preparation. The current landscape of recipe applications often requires users to search for specific dishes or browse broad categories, rather than proactively suggesting meals based on what's already on hand. This gap leads to: 
*   **Food Waste:** Perishable ingredients expire before being used.
*   **Meal Monotony:** Users stick to a limited repertoire of dishes.
*   **Inefficient Shopping:** Unnecessary purchases of ingredients already at home.
*   **Time Consumption:** Extensive searching and planning to match recipes with ingredients.

*   **Busy Individuals/Families:** Looking for convenient and time-saving meal planning solutions.

**Motivations:** They want to simplify meal preparation, reduce the mental load of deciding 'what to cook,' make the most of their existing groceries, minimize food waste, discover new and exciting dishes, and eat more diverse and balanced meals.

**Goals:** Their goals include efficient ingredient utilization, reducing food costs, expanding their recipe repertoire, saving time in meal planning, and contributing to a more sustainable lifestyle.
