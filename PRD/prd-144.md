## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a novel web platform designed to address the challenges associated with viewing, processing, and managing extremely large image files (multi-gigabyte to terabyte scale) within web environments. The primary purpose of this project is to provide professionals and researchers with a highly efficient, web-based tool for dynamic image chunking, selective viewing, and precise downloading of specific regions of interest from massive datasets. By doing so, the platform aims to significantly enhance productivity, enable new analytical workflows, and make large-scale image data more accessible and manageable online, thereby bridging the gap between specialized desktop applications and the collaborative potential of web-based solutions.

## 2. Problem Statement

Users across various high-resolution imaging domains—such as geospatial analysis, medical diagnostics, scientific research, and digital archiving—face significant hurdles in efficiently interacting with and managing their increasingly large image files. Traditional web browsers are inherently limited in handling multi-gigabyte or terabyte images due to memory constraints, slow load times, and inadequate rendering capabilities. This forces users to either rely on cumbersome desktop-bound software, which hinders collaboration and remote access, or to engage in time-consuming and bandwidth-intensive processes of downloading entire massive files, only to extract a small section. The pain points include:

*   **Performance Bottlenecks:** Web browsers struggle to load and display high-resolution images, leading to excessive wait times and system freezes.
*   **Inefficient Data Transfer:** Downloading entire multi-GB/TB images is often impractical and unnecessary, wasting bandwidth and storage for users who only need a specific region.
*   **Lack of Web-Based Specialization:** Existing web solutions often lack the precision, performance, and advanced features (e.g., deep zoom, complex ROI selection) required for professional-grade large image handling.
*   **Workflow Inefficiencies:** The inability to easily view, process, and share specific sections of large images online disrupts analytical workflows and hinders collaborative efforts.
