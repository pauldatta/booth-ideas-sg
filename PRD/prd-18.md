# Recipe Genie: AI-Powered Ingredient-Based Recipe Suggester

## 1. Introduction

Recipe Genie is a mobile application designed to revolutionize the way home cooks approach meal preparation. The primary purpose of this project is to empower users to efficiently utilize the ingredients they currently possess, thereby reducing food waste, saving money, and inspiring culinary creativity. By leveraging advanced AI, Recipe Genie will provide instant, tailored recipe suggestions based on a user's available pantry items, transforming the challenge of 'what to cook?' into an exciting journey of discovery.

## 2. Problem Statement

Home cooks frequently encounter significant challenges when planning meals and utilizing existing food items. A common pain point is the inability to find suitable recipes that precisely match the ingredients they have on hand, leading to several undesirable outcomes:

*   **Food Waste:** Perishable ingredients often expire or go unused because users cannot easily integrate them into meals, contributing to significant household food waste and associated financial loss.
*   **Decision Fatigue:** The process of meal planning can be overwhelming. Users spend excessive time browsing generic recipes online, only to find they lack key ingredients or the recipes don't align with their current inventory.
