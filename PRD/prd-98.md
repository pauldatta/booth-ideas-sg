# Product Requirements Document: Avian Scout

## 1. Introduction

Avian Scout is a mobile application designed to revolutionize the way bird populations are monitored in urban parks. Recognizing the critical role of avian biodiversity as an indicator of ecological health, this project aims to provide an accessible, accurate, and engaging tool for collecting bird population data. By leveraging advanced AI, Avian Scout will empower birdwatchers, environmental researchers, and citizen scientists to effortlessly identify and count bird species, thereby enhancing ecological understanding and fostering greater participation in citizen science initiatives.

## 2. Problem Statement

Manually counting bird populations in public parks presents significant challenges for both amateur enthusiasts and professional researchers. The current methods are often time-consuming, prone to human error, and lack the consistency required for robust scientific data collection. 

**Pain Points:**

*   **For Researchers:** Inconsistent data quality due to varied observer skill levels, labor-intensive fieldwork, limited geographical scope for comprehensive studies, and difficulty in tracking long-term population trends accurately and efficiently. This leads to gaps in ecological understanding and hampers conservation efforts.
*   **For Birdwatchers & Citizen Scientists:** Difficulty in accurately identifying diverse bird species, especially for novices, leading to frustration and disengagement. The manual logging process is tedious and cumbersome, discouraging regular contributions. There's also a lack of a centralized, user-friendly platform to easily contribute observations and view aggregated local data.
*   **General:** The absence of real-time, high-resolution data on avian populations limits our ability to quickly respond to ecological changes and implement effective conservation strategies. Current methods often miss opportunities for widespread community engagement in scientific data collection.

## 3. Target Audience

The primary users of Avian Scout are individuals with an interest in ornithology, environmental science, and outdoor exploration. They are motivated by a desire to connect with nature, contribute to scientific knowledge, and understand the ecological health of their local environments.

*   **Birdwatchers/Nature Enthusiasts:**
    *   **Motivations:** Enjoy spending time outdoors, keen to identify new species, track personal sightings, deepen their knowledge of local wildlife, and contribute to conservation passively.
    *   **Goals:** Easy and accurate bird identification, a personal logbook of their sightings, discovering new birding locations, and learning more about bird behavior and habitats.
*   **Environmental Researchers:**
    *   **Motivations:** Collect robust, consistent ecological data, monitor bird population trends for scientific studies, understand biodiversity indicators, and support conservation initiatives with empirical evidence.
    *   **Goals:** Reliable and efficient data collection in the field, tools for data analysis and export, and the ability to collaborate on larger research projects.
*   **Citizen Scientists:**
    *   **Motivations:** Contribute meaningfully to scientific research, engage with their local community, learn about environmental issues, and make a tangible impact on conservation efforts.
    *   **Goals:** Simple and intuitive submission of observations, seeing the collective impact of their contributions, and connecting with a broader community of like-minded individuals.

## 4. Goals/Objectives

The following SMART goals outline the key business and user objectives for Avian Scout:

**Business Goals:**

*   **User Acquisition:** Achieve 5,000 monthly active users (MAU) within 6 months of public launch, primarily through targeted marketing to birdwatching communities and environmental groups.
*   **Partnerships:** Establish formal partnerships with at least 3 environmental research organizations or citizen science platforms within 12 months, leading to data sharing and potential premium feature collaboration.
*   **AI Accuracy:** Attain an average AI bird identification accuracy rate of 80% for the top 50 most common bird species in target regions within 3 months post-launch, as validated by user feedback and expert review.
*   **Monetization (Future):** Explore and validate at least two potential premium feature models (e.g., advanced analytics, specialized guides) with a pilot group within 18 months, aiming for a 5% conversion rate for premium offerings.

**User Goals:**

*   **Data Contribution:** Facilitate the logging of over 100,000 unique bird observations across all users within the first year of launch, demonstrating significant user engagement and data accumulation.
*   **Efficiency:** Reduce the average time taken for users to accurately log a bird sighting (from observation to recorded data) by 50% compared to traditional manual methods (field guide + notebook) within 3 months of launch.
*   **Satisfaction:** Achieve an average user satisfaction score of 4.5 out of 5 on core identification and logging features, measured via in-app surveys and app store reviews, within 6 months of launch.
*   **Education:** Increase user knowledge about local bird species by providing educational content accessed by at least 25% of active users monthly.
