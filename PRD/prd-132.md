# Product Requirements Document: Singapore Single Origin Coffee Roaster Recommendations

## 1. Introduction
This document outlines the requirements for a new mobile application aimed at revolutionizing how coffee enthusiasts in Singapore discover and engage with single-origin coffee roasters. The project, tentatively named "BeanCompass Singapore," seeks to provide expertly curated recommendations and detailed profiles of top single-origin coffee roasters, leveraging artificial intelligence to personalize the discovery experience. Our goal is to empower users to effortlessly find exceptional coffee, thereby enhancing their enjoyment and supporting the vibrant local specialty coffee scene.

## 2. Problem Statement
Singapore's coffee landscape is rich and diverse, yet discerning coffee enthusiasts face significant challenges in consistently identifying and accessing high-quality single-origin coffee roasters. The primary pain points include:

*   **Information Overload & Fragmentation:** While numerous cafes and roasters exist, comprehensive and up-to-date information on single-origin bean availability, roast profiles, and roaster philosophies is scattered across various blogs, social media, and individual websites, making consistent discovery cumbersome.
*   **Lack of Curated Trust:** Users often rely on word-of-mouth or trial-and-error, which can be time-consuming and lead to inconsistent experiences. There's a clear need for a trusted, expert-driven platform that vets and highlights the best roasters.
*   **Personalized Discovery Gap:** General search tools don't cater to nuanced coffee preferences (e.g., specific processing methods, flavor notes, origin regions, roast levels), making it difficult for users to find beans truly tailored to their taste.
*   **Limited Accessibility for New Discoveries:** Many hidden gems or smaller, artisanal roasters struggle for visibility, meaning users often stick to well-known establishments, missing out on unique single-origin offerings.

This product aims to bridge these gaps, offering a streamlined, intelligent solution for discovering the best single-origin coffee experiences in Singapore.
