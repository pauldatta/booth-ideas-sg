# Product Requirements Document: Cabinet Keeper

## 1. Introduction

Cabinet Keeper is a mobile application designed to empower individuals to efficiently manage their home beverage collections. In an age where forgotten items and duplicate purchases are common in household inventories, this product aims to provide a systematic and intuitive solution. Our primary goal is to help users maintain an accurate, real-time inventory of all drinks stored in their cabinets, reducing waste, improving organization, and enhancing their overall home management experience.

## 2. Problem Statement

Many individuals face significant challenges in accurately and efficiently tracking the beverages they store at home. This often leads to a variety of pain points:

*   **Forgotten Items:** Drinks are purchased, stored, and then forgotten, leading to eventual spoilage and waste.
*   **Duplicate Purchases:** Users often buy items they already possess simply because they are unaware of their current stock, resulting in unnecessary expenses and cabinet clutter.
*   **Disorganization:** A lack of systematic inventory leads to disorganized storage spaces, making it difficult to locate specific items when needed.
*   **Missed Expiry Dates:** Without proper tracking, beverages can expire before consumption, leading to financial loss and potential health risks if consumed unknowingly.
*   **Inefficient Entertaining:** Hosts struggle to know what drinks are available for guests, hindering their ability to plan events or mix cocktails effectively.

These issues collectively contribute to financial waste, frustration, and an overall inefficient management of a common household asset: the beverage collection.
