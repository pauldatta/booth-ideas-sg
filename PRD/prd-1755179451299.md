## 1. Introduction
This document outlines the requirements for a mobile application designed to revolutionize home cooking. The primary purpose of this project is to create an intuitive and intelligent platform that empowers users to effortlessly discover new meal ideas based on the ingredients they already possess. By leveraging artificial intelligence, the application aims to minimize food waste, reduce grocery expenses, and enhance culinary creativity, ultimately leading to a more efficient and diverse cooking experience for households.

## 2. Problem Statement
In many households, a common challenge is the accumulation of various ingredients without a clear strategy for their optimal utilization. This often results in a cycle of repetitive meals, forgotten ingredients leading to spoilage, and unnecessary food waste. Users frequently experience frustration when trying to conceptualize new dishes from their existing pantry and refrigerator contents, leading them to either purchase additional items they don't need or discard perfectly good food. The pain points include:
*   **Food Waste:** Unused ingredients expire, leading to significant financial loss and environmental impact.
*   **Repetitive Meals:** Users get stuck in a rut, cooking the same few dishes because they lack inspiration for new combinations.
*   **Budget Inefficiency:** Constant purchasing of new ingredients, even when existing ones could suffice, inflates grocery bills.
*   **Lack of Culinary Inspiration:** Difficulty in creatively combining diverse ingredients to form appealing and palatable meals.
*   **Time Consumption:** Manually searching for recipes based on multiple ingredients is cumbersome and time-consuming.
