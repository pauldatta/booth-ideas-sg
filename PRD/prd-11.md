# Product Requirements Document: Ingredient-Based Recipe Suggester

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a new mobile application designed to help users efficiently utilize ingredients they currently have on hand.

*   **Repetitive Meals:** Users often stick to a narrow repertoire of familiar dishes, even when diverse ingredients are available, leading to meal monotony.
*   **Decision Fatigue:** The mental burden of meal planning and ingredient matching can be time-consuming and stressful, especially after a long day.
