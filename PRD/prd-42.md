# Product Requirements Document: AquaReminder

## 1. Introduction

The AquaReminder project aims to develop a dedicated mobile application designed to assist pet fish owners in maintaining a consistent and optimal feeding schedule for their aquatic companions. In today's fast-paced world, it's easy for even the most diligent pet owners to forget routine tasks. This application will serve as a reliable digital assistant, providing timely feeding reminders and a comprehensive log of feeding history. The ultimate goal is to improve the health and well-being of pet fish through consistent care, thereby providing peace of mind to their owners.

## 2. Problem Statement

Many pet fish owners, regardless of their experience level, face challenges in consistently adhering to a regular feeding schedule. This oversight can stem from busy lifestyles, simple forgetfulness, or a lack of structured tools to manage feeding times. The pain points associated with this problem include:

*   **Inconsistent Care:** Irregular feeding can lead to stress for fish, impacting their growth, color, and overall vitality.
*   **Health Impacts:** Underfeeding can result in malnutrition and weakened immune systems, making fish susceptible to disease. Overfeeding can lead to poor water quality, algae blooms, and unhealthy fish due to excess nutrients and uneaten food.
*   **Owner Guilt & Stress:** Forgetting to feed pets can cause significant guilt and anxiety for owners, diminishing the joy of pet ownership.
*   **Lack of Tracking:** Without a systematic way to log feeding events, owners lack historical data to identify patterns, adjust diets, or troubleshoot health issues related to feeding.

This application directly addresses these pain points by providing a structured, proactive, and easy-to-use solution.
