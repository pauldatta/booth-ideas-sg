				<p>The app will automatically detect when the user has parked their car and log the precise GPS coordinates. This detection will rely on a combination of factors, including cessation of vehicle movement (via accelerometer/gyroscope data), disconnect from car's Bluetooth/Apple CarPlay/Android Auto, and changes in Wi-Fi networks.</p>

				<h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-2">Manual Parking Details Input</h2>
				<p>Users can manually add or edit details about their parking spot, such as floor number, section, specific row/pillar identification, and even attach a photo or a voice memo. This enhances accuracy in complex environments like multi-story garages.</p>
